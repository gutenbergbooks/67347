</div>


<p>There, in that land set apart for Silence, and Space,
and the Great Winds, Fate&mdash;a grim, still figure&mdash;sat
at her loom weaving the destinies of desert men and
women. The shuttles shot to and fro without ceasing,
and into the strange web were woven the threads of
Light, and Joy, and Love; but more often were they
those of Sorrow, or Death, or Sin. From the wide
Gray Waste the Weaver had drawn the color and
design; and so the fabric&#8217;s warp and woof were of
the desert&#8217;s tone. Keeping this always well in mind
will help you the better to understand those people of
the plains, whose lives must needs be often sombre-hued.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">MISS GLENDOWER sat on the ranch-house
piazza, shading her eyes from the
white glare of the sun by holding above
them&mdash;in beautiful, beringed fingers&mdash;the
last number of a Boston magazine.
It was all very new and delightful to
her&mdash;this strange, unfinished country, and each day
developed fresh charm. As a spectacle it was perfect&mdash;the
very desolation and silence of the desert stirred
something within her that the Back Bay had never
remotely roused. Viewed from the front row of the
dress circle, as it were, nothing could be more fascinating
to her art-loving sense than this simple, wholesome
life lived out as Nature teaches, and to feel
that, for the time, the big, conventional world of wise
insincerities was completely shut away behind those
far purple mountains out of which rose the desert sun.</p>

<p>As for becoming an integral part of all this one&#8217;s
self&mdash;Ah, that was a different matter! The very
thought of her cousin, Blanche Madison, and Roy&mdash;her
husband&mdash;deliberately turning their backs on the
refinements of civilization, and accepting the daily
drudgery and routine of life on a cattle ranch, filled
her with wondering amazement. When she fell to
speculating on what their future years here would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
be, she shuddered. From the crown of her sleek and
perfectly poised little head, to the hollowed sole of
her modishly booted foot, Miss Audrey Glendower
was Bostonian.</p>

<p>Still, for the short space of time that she waited
Lawrence Irving&#8217;s coming, life here was full of charm
for her&mdash;its ways were alluring, and not the least
among its fascinations was Mesquite.</p>

<p>She smiled amusedly as she thought of the tall cowboy&#8217;s
utter unconsciousness of any social difference
between them&mdash;at his simple acceptance of her notice.
Miss Glendower was finding vast entertainment in his
honest-hearted, undisguised adoration. She had come
West for experiences, and one of the first (as decidedly
the most exciting and interesting) had been
found in Mesquite. Besides, it gave her something
to write of when she sent her weekly letter to Lawrence
Irving. Sometimes she found writing to him
a bit of a bore&mdash;when topics were few.</p>

<p>But Mesquite&mdash;&mdash; The boy was a revelation of
fresh surprises every day. There was no boredom where
he was. Amusing; yes, that was the word. There
he was now!&mdash;crossing the bare and hard beaten
square of gray earth that lay between the ranch house
and the corrals. Though he was looking beyond
the piazza to where the other boys were driving a
&#8220;bunch&#8221; of bellowing, dust-stirring cattle into an
enclosure, yet she felt it was she whom his eyes saw.
He was coming straight toward the house&mdash;and her.
She knew it. Miss Glendower knew many things,
learned in the varied experience of her eight-and-twenty
years. Her worldly wisdom was more&mdash;much
more&mdash;than his would be at double his present age.
Mesquite was twenty.</p>

<p>He looked up with unconcealed pleasure in her presence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
as he seated himself on the piazza&mdash;swinging his
spurred heels against each other, while he leaned his
head back against one of the pillars. Miss Glendower&#8217;s
eyes rested on the burned, boyish face with
delight. There was something so n&auml;ive, so sweetly
childish about him. It was simply delicious to hear
his &#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; or his &#8220;Which?&#8221; Just now his
yellow hair lay in little damp rings on his forehead,
like a baby&#8217;s just awakened from sleep. He sat
with his big, dust-covered sombrero shoved back from
a forehead guiltless of tan or freckles as the petals of
a white rose. But the lower part of his face was
roughened by wind and burned by the sun to an Indian
red, making the blue eyes the bluer&mdash;those great,
babyish eyes that looked out with a belying innocence
from under their marvelous fringe of upcurling lashes.
The blue eyes were well used to looking upon sights
that would have shocked Miss Glendower&#8217;s New
England training, could she have known; and the
babyish lips were quite familiar with language that
would have made her pale with horror and disgust
to hear. But then, she didn&#8217;t know. Neither could
he have understood her standpoint.</p>

<p>He was only the product of his environment, and
one of the best things that it had taught him was to
have no disguises. So he sat today looking up at his
lady with all his love showing in his face.</p>

<p>Then, in the late afternoon warmth, as the day&#8217;s red
ball of burning wrath dropped down behind the western
desert rim of their little world, he rode beside her,
across sand hills where sweet flowers began to open
their snow-white petals to the night wind&#8217;s touch, and
over barren alkali flats to the postoffice half a dozen
miles away.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>There was only one letter waiting for Miss Glendower
that night. It began:</p>

<p>&#8220;I will be with you, my darling, twenty-four hours
after you get this. Just one more day, Love, and I
may hold you in my arms again! Just one more week,
and you will be my wife, Audrey. Think of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>She had thought; she was thinking now. She was
also wondering how Mesquite would take it. She
glanced at the boy as she put the letter away and
turned her horse&#8217;s head toward home. Such a short
time and she would return to the old life that, for
the hour, seemed so strangely far away! Now&mdash;alone
in the desert with Mesquite&mdash;it would not be hard
to persuade herself that this was all there was of the
world or of life.</p>

<p>As they loped across the wide stretch of desert flats
that reached to the sand hills, shutting the ranch from
sight, the twilight fell, and with it came sharp gusts
of wind that now and then brought a whirl of desert
dust. Harder and harder it blew. Nearer and
nearer&mdash;then it fell upon them in its malevolence, to
catch them&mdash;to hold them in its uncanny clasp an
instant&mdash;and then, releasing them, go madly racing
off to the farther twilight, moaning in undertone as
it went. Then heat lightning struck vividly at the
horizon, and the air everywhere became surcharged
with the electric current of a desert sand storm. They
heard its roar coming up the valley. Audrey Glendower
felt her nerves a-tingle. This, too, was an experience!
In sheer delight she laughed aloud at the
excitement showing in the quivering horses&mdash;their ears
nervously pointing forward, and their nostrils distended,
as with long, eager strides they pounded away
over the wind-beaten levels.</p>

<p>Then the storm caught them at its wildest. Suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
a tumble-weed, dry and uprooted from its
slight moorings somewhere away on the far side of
the flats, came whirling toward them broadside in
the vortex of a mad rush of wind in which&mdash;without
warning&mdash;they were in an instant enveloped. As the
great, rolling, ball-like weed struck her horse, Miss
Glendower took a tighter grip on the reins and
steadied herself for the runaway rush into the dust
storm and the darkness. The wild wind caught her,
shrieked in her ears, tore at her habit as though to
wrest it from her body, dragged at the braids of heavy
hair until&mdash;loosened&mdash;the strands whipped about her
head, a tangled mass of stinging lashes.</p>

<p>She was alone&mdash;drawn into the maelstrom of the
mad element; alone&mdash;with the fury of the desert
storm; alone&mdash;in the awful darkness it wrapped about
her, the darkness of the strange storm and the darkness
of the coming night. The frightened, furious
horse beneath her terrified her less than the weird,
rainless storm that had so swiftly slipped in between
her and Mesquite, carrying her away into its unknown
depths. Where was he? In spite of the mastering
fear that was gaining upon her, in spite of
her struggle for courage, was a consciousness which
told her that more than all else&mdash;that more than everyone
else in the world&mdash;it was Mesquite she wanted.
Had others, to the number of a great army, ridden
down to her rescue she would have turned away from
them all to reach out her arms to the boy vaquero.
Perhaps it was because she had seen his marvelous
feats of daring in the saddle (for Mesquite was the
star rider of the range), and she felt instinctively
that he could help her as none other; perhaps it was
because of the past days that had so drawn him toward
her; perhaps (and most likely) it was because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
he had but just been at her side. However it might
be, she was praying with all her soul for his help&mdash;for
him to come to her&mdash;while mile after mile she
rode on, unable to either guide or slacken the stride
of her horse. His pace had been terrific; and not
until it had carried him out of the line of the storm,
and up from the plain into the sand hills, did he lessen
his speed. Then the hoofs were dragged down by the
heavy sand, and the storm&#8217;s strength&mdash;all but spent&mdash;was
left away back on the desert.</p>

<p>She felt about her only the softest of West winds;
the dust that had strangled her was gone, and in its
place was the syringa-like fragrance of the wild, white
primroses, star-strewing the earth, as the heavens were
strewn with their own night blossoms.</p>

<p>Just above the purple-black bar of the horizon burned
a great blood-red star in the sky. It danced and wavered
before her&mdash;rising and falling unsteadily&mdash;and
she realized that her strength was spent&mdash;that she was
falling. Then, just as the loosened girth let the saddle
turn with her swaying body, a hand caught at her
bridle-rein, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Ah, she was lying sobbing and utterly weak, but
unutterably happy, on Mesquite&#8217;s breast&mdash;Mesquite&#8217;s
arms about her! She made no resistance to the passionate
kisses the boyish lips laid half fearfully on her
face. She was only glad of the sweetness of it all;
just as the sweetness of the evening primroses (so like
the fragrance of jasmine, or tuberose, or syringa) sunk
into her senses. So she rested against his breast, seeing
still&mdash;through closed eyelids&mdash;the glowing, red
star. She was unstrung by the wild ride and the winds
that had wrought on her nerves. It made yielding so
easy.</p>

<p>At last she drew back from him; and instantly his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
arms were unlocked. She was free! Not a second of
time would he clasp her unwillingly. Neither had
spoken. Nor, after resetting the saddle, when he took
her again in his arms and lifted her, as he would a
little child, upon her horse, did they speak. Only when
the ranch buildings&mdash;outlined against the darkness&mdash;showed
dimly before them, and they knew that the
ride was at an end, did he voice what was uppermost
in his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yo&#8217; don&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash; Yo&#8217; ain&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash; Oh, my pretty,
yo&#8217; ain&#8217;t mad at me, are yo&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Mesquite,&#8221; came the softly whispered answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad o&#8217; that. Shore, I didn&#8217;t mean fur to go
an&#8217; do sech a thing; but&mdash;&mdash; Gawd! I couldn&#8217;t help it.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But when lifting her down at the ranch-house gate he
would have again held her sweetness a moment within
his clasp, Miss Glendower (she was once again Miss
Glendower of the great world) let her cool, steady
voice slip between:</p>

<p>&#8220;The letter I got tonight is from the man I am to
marry in a week. He will be here tomorrow. But,
I want to tell you&mdash;&mdash; Mesquite&mdash;&mdash; I want you
to know that I&mdash;I shall always remember this ride of
ours. Always.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mesquite did not answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, Mesquite.&#8221; She waited. Still there
was no reply.</p>

<p>Mesquite led the horses away and Miss Glendower
turned and went into the house. Being an uneducated
cowboy he was remiss in many matters of courtesy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Lawrence Irving arrived at the Madison
ranch, his host, in the list of entertainment he was
offering the Bostonian, promised an exhibition of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
bronco riding that would stir even the beat of that serene
gentleman&#8217;s well regulated pulse.</p>

<p>&#8220;This morning,&#8221; said Madison, &#8220;I was afraid that
I wouldn&#8217;t be able to get my star bronco buster out
for your edification, Lawrence, for the boys have been
telling me that he has been &#8216;hitting the jug&#8217; pretty
lively down at the store for the past twenty-four
hours (he&#8217;s never been much of a drinker, either), but
when I told him Miss Glendower wanted to show you
the convolutions of a bucking horse, it seemed to sober
him up a bit, and he not only promised to furnish the
thrills, but to do the business up with all the trimmings
on&mdash;for he&#8217;s going to ride &#8216;Sobrepaso,&#8217; a big,
blaze-face sorrel that they call &#8216;the man killer,&#8217; and
that every vaquero in the country has given up unconquered.
Mesquite himself refused to mount him
again, some time ago; but today he is in a humor that
I can&#8217;t quite understand&mdash;even allowing for all the
bad whiskey that he&#8217;s been getting away with&mdash;and
seems not only ready but eager to tackle anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful to you, Rob,&#8221; began Irving, &#8220;for&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ll have to thank Audrey for the show!
Mesquite is doing it solely for her sake. He has been
her abject slave ever since she came.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both men laughed and looked at Miss Glendower,
who did not even smile. It might have been that she
did not hear them. They rose and went out to the
shaded piazza where it was cooler. The heat was making
Miss Glendower look pale.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They, and the ranch hands who saw &#8220;Sobrepaso&#8221;
(&#8220;the beautiful red devil,&#8221; Mrs. Madison called him)
brought out into the gray, hard beaten square that
formed the arena, felt a thrill of nervous expectancy&mdash;a
chilling thrill&mdash;as Mesquite made ready to mount.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
The horse was blindfolded ere the saddle was thrown
on; but with all the fury of a fiend he fought&mdash;in turn&mdash;blanket,
and saddle, and cincha. The jaquima
was slipped on, the stirrups tied together under the
horse&#8217;s belly, and all the while his squeals of rage and
maddened snorts were those of an untamed beast that
would battle to the death. The blind then was pulled
up from his eyes, and&mdash;at the end of a sixty-foot riata&mdash;he
was freed to go bucking and plunging in a
fury of uncontrolled wrath around the enclosure. At
last sweating and with every nerve twitching in his
mad hatred of the meddling of Man he was brought to
a standstill, and the blind was slipped down once
more. He stood with all four feet braced stiffly, awkwardly
apart, and his head down, while Mesquite
hitched the cartridge belt (from which hung his pistol&#8217;s
holster) in place; tightened the wide-brimmed,
battered hat on his head; slipped the strap of a quirt
on his wrist; looked at the fastenings of his big-rowelled,
jingling spurs; and then (with a quick, upward
glance at Miss Glendower&mdash;the first he had given her)
he touched caressingly a little bunch of white primroses
he had plucked that morning from their bed in
the sand hills and pinned to the lapel of his unbuttoned
vest.</p>

<p>Mesquite had gathered the reins into his left hand,
and was ready for his cat-like spring into place. His
left foot was thrust into the stirrup&mdash;there was the
sweep of a long leg thrown across the saddle&mdash;a sinuous
swing into place, and Mesquite&mdash;&#8220;the star rider of
the range&#8221; had mounted the man killer. Quickly the
blind was whipped up from the blood-shot eyes, the
spurred heels gripped onto the cincha, there was a
shout from his rider and a devilish sound from the mustang
as he made his first upward leap, and then went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
madly fighting his way around and around the enclosure.</p>

<p>Mesquite sat the infuriated animal as though
he himself were but a part of the sorrel whirlwind.
His seat was superb. Miss Glendower felt a tremor
of pride stir her as she watched him&mdash;pride that her
lover should witness this matchless horsemanship. She
was panting between fear and delight while she
watched the boy&#8217;s face (wearing the sweet, boyish
smile&mdash;like, yet so unlike&mdash;the smile she had come to
know in the past weeks), and the yellow curls blowing
back from the bared forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sobrepaso&#8221; rose in his leaps to great heights&mdash;almost
falling backward&mdash;to plunge forward, with
squeals of rage that he could not unseat his rider. The
boy sat there, a king&mdash;king of his own little world,
while he slapped at the sorrel&#8217;s head and withers with
the sombrero that swung in his hand. Plunging
and leaping, round and round&mdash;now here and now
there&mdash;about the enclosure they went, the horse a mad
hurricane and his rider a centaur. Mesquite was
swayed back and forth, to and fro, but no surge could
unseat him. Miss Glendower grew warm in her joy of
him as she looked.</p>

<p>Then, somehow (as the &#8220;man killer&#8221; made another
great upward leap) the pistol swinging from Mesquite&#8217;s
belt was thrown from its holster, and&mdash;striking the
cantle of the saddle as it fell&mdash;there was a sharp report,
and a cloud-like puff (not from the dust raised by beating
hoofs), and a sound (not the terrible sounds made
by a maddened horse), and the boy swayed backward&mdash;backward&mdash;with
the boyish smile chilled on his lips,
and the wet, yellow curls blowing back from his white
forehead that soon would grow yet whiter.</p>



<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>Miss Glendower did not faint, neither did she
scream; she was one with her emotions held always
well in hand, and she expressed the proper amount of
regret the occasion required&mdash;shuddering a little over
its horror. But to this day (and she is Mrs. Lawrence
Irving now) she cannot look quite steadily at a big, red
star that sometimes burns in the West at early eve;
and the scent of tuberoses, or jasmine, or syringa makes
her deathly sick.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE REVOLT OF MARTHA SCOTT</h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/t.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE was nothing pleasing in the scene.
It was in that part of the vast West
where a gray sky looked down upon the
grayer soil beneath; where neither brilliant
birds nor bright blossoms, nor glittering
rivulets made lovely the place in
which human beings went up and down the earth
daily performing those labors that made the sum of
what they called life. Neither tree nor shrub, nor
spear of grass showed green with the healthy color of
plant-life. As far as the eye could reach was the monotonous
gray of sagebrush, and greasewood, and sand.
The muddy river, with its myriad curves, ran between
abrupt banks of soft alkali ground, where now and
then as it ate into the confining walls, portions would
fall with a loud splash into the water. A hurrying,
treacherous river&mdash;with its many silent eddies&mdash;it
turned and twisted and doubled on itself a thousand
times as it wound its way down the valley. Here,
where it circled in a great curve called &#8220;Scott&#8217;s Bend,&#8221;
the waters were always being churned by the ponderous
wheel of a little quartz-mill, painted by storm and
sunshine in the leaden tones of its sad-colored surroundings.</p>

<p>On the bluff above, near the ore platform, were
grouped a dozen houses. Fenceless, they faced the mill,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
which day after day pounded away at the ore with a
maddening monotony. All day, all night, the stamps
kept up their ceaseless monotone. The weather-worn
mill and drab adobe houses had stood there, year after
year, through the heat of summer days, when the
sun blistered and burned the whole valley, and in winter,
when the winds of the desert moaned and wailed at
the windows.</p>

<p>Today the air is quiet, save for the tiny whirlwinds
that, running over the tailings below the mill, have
caught up the fine powder and carried bits of it away
with them, a white cloud, as they went. The sun, too,
is shining painfully bright and burning. By the well
a woman stands, her eyes intently following a chance
wayfarer who has turned into the Sherman road&mdash;in
all the waste, the only moving thing.</p>

<p>How surely human beings take on themselves the
reflection of their surroundings! Living in the dull solitude
of this valley that woman&#8217;s life has become but a
gray reflection of its never-ending sameness. As we
look, we fall a-wondering. Has she never known what
it is to live in the way we understand it? Has nothing
ever set her pulses tingling with the exultation of Life?
Does she know only an existence which is but the compulsory
working of a piece of human machinery? Has
she never known what it is to feel hope, or joy, or love,
in the way we feel it&mdash;never experienced one single
stirring emotion in the whole round of her pitifully
barren life? Is it possible that she has never realized
the poverty of her existence?</p>

<p>Yet, she was a creature meant for Life. What a beautiful
woman she is, too, with all that brilliance of coloring&mdash;that
copper-hued hair, and those great, velvety
eyes, lovely in spite of their apathetic stare. What a
model for some painter&#8217;s brush! Such beauty and such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
apathy combined; such expressionless perfection of
feature; &#8220;faultily faultless, icily regular, splendidly
null&mdash;dead perfection.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martha Scott is one of those women whose commanding
figure and magnificent coloring are always
sufficient to attract the admiration of even the most indifferent.
No doubt now in her maturity she is far more
beautiful than when, nearly twenty years ago, she became
Old Scott&#8217;s wife. A tall, unformed girl then,
she gave no promise of her later beauty, except in the
velvety softness of the great eyes that never seemed
to take heed of anything in the world about her, and
the great mass of shining hair that had the red-gold
of a Western sunset in it.</p>

<p>There had been a courtship so brief that they were
still strangers when he took her to the small, untidy
house where he had come to realize that the presence of
a woman was needed. He wanted a wife to cook for
him; to wash&mdash;to sew. And so they were married.</p>

<p>The sheep which numbered thousands, the little mill&mdash;always
grinding in its jaws the ores brought down
the mountain by the snail-paced teams to fill its hungry
maw, these added daily to the hoard Old Scott clutched
with gripping, penurious fingers. Early and late, unceasingly,
he worked, and chose that Martha should
labor as he labored, live as he lived. But, as she mechanically
took up her burden of life, there came to the
sweet, uncomplaining mouth a droop at the corners that
grew with the years, telling to those who had the eyes
to see, that while accepting with mute lips the unhappy
conditions of her lot, she longed with all her starved
soul for something different from her yearly round of
never-ending toil.</p>

<p>Once&mdash;only once&mdash;in a whirlwind of revolt, she felt
that she could endure it no longer&mdash;that she must break<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
away from the dull routine which made the measure of
her days; felt that she must go out among happy human
beings&mdash;to be in the rush and whirl of life under
Pleasure&#8217;s sunshine&mdash;to bask in its warmth as others
did. She longed to enjoy life as Youth enjoys; herself
to be young once more. Yes, even to dance as she
had danced when a girl! In the upheaval of her passionate
revolt, flushed and trembling, she begged her
husband to take her to one of the country balls of the
neighborhood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take me wunst!&#8221; she pleaded, her eyes glistening
with unshed tears; &#8220;only this wunst; I won&#8217;t never ask
you no more. But I do want to have one right good
time. You never take me nowheres. Please take me,
Fred, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Scott straightened himself from the task over
which he was bending and looked at her in incredulous
wonder. For more than a minute he stared at her;
then, breaking into a loud laugh, he mocked:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d look pretty, now, wouldn&#8217;t you, a-goin&#8217; and
a-toein&#8217; it like you was a young gal!&#8221;</p>

<p>She shrank from him as though he had raised a lash
over her, and the light died out of her face. Without
a word she turned and went back to her work.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Martha Scott never again alluded to the meagre
pleasures of her life. She went back to her work of
cooking the coarse food which was their only fare; of
mending the heavy, uncouth clothing which week-day
and Sunday alike, was her husband&#8217;s only apparel; of
washing and ironing the cheap calicoes, and coarse, unbleached
muslins of her own poor, and scanty wardrobe,
fulfilling her part as a bread-winner. The man
never saw that he failed in performing the part of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
good and loving husband; and if anyone had pointed
out to him that her existence was impoverished by
his indifference and neglect, he still would have been
unable to see wherein he had erred. He would have argued
that she had enough to eat, enough to wear; that
they owned their home&mdash;their neighbors having no better,
nor any larger; he was laying aside money all the
time; he did not drink; he never struck her. What
more could any woman ask?</p>

<p>That the home which suited him, and the life to
which he was used, could be other than all she desired,
had never once occurred to him. As a boy, &#8220;back East&#8221;
in the old days, he had never cared for the sports and
pleasures enjoyed by other young people. How much
less, now that the natural pleasure-time of life was
past, could he tolerate pleasure-seeking in others!</p>

<p>&#8220;Folks show better sense to work an&#8217; save their
money,&#8221; he would say, &#8220;than to go gaddin&#8217; about
havin&#8217; a good time an&#8217; comin&#8217; home broke.&#8221;</p>

<p>Together they lived in the house which through all
their married life they had called &#8220;home;&#8221; together
they worked side by side through all their years of
youth and middle age. But not farther are we from the
farthest star than were these two apart in their real
lives. Yet she was his wife; this woman for whom he
had no dearer name than &#8220;Marth&#8217;,&#8221; and to whom&mdash;for
years&mdash;he had given no caress. She looked the incarnation
of indifference and apathy. Ah! but was she?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A few years ago there came a mining expert from
San Francisco to examine the Yellow Bird mine; and
with him came a younger man, who appeared to have
no particular business but to look around at the country,
and to fish and hunt. There is the finest kind of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
sport for the hunter over in the Smoky Range; and this
fellow, Baird&mdash;Alfred Baird was his name&mdash;spent much
of his time there shooting antelope and deer.</p>

<p>He was courteous and gentle mannered; he was
finely educated&mdash;polished in address; he spoke three or
four languages, and was good to look at. He stayed
with the Scotts for a time&mdash;and a long time it proved
to be; a self-invited guest, whether or no. Yet all the
while he did not fail to reiterate his intentions to
&#8220;handsomely remunerate them for their generous hospitality
in a country where there were so few or no
hotels.&#8221; He assured them he was &#8220;daily expecting a
remittance from home. The delay was inexcusable&mdash;unless
the mail had miscarried. Very annoying! So
embarrassing!&#8221; And so on. It was the old stereotyped
story which that sort of a fellow always carries
on the tip of his tongue. And the wonder of it all was
that Scott&mdash;surly and gruff to all others&mdash;was so completely
under the scamp&#8217;s will, and ready to humor his
slightest wish. Baird used without question his saddle
and best horse; and it was Scott who fitted him out
whenever he went hunting deer over in the Smokies.</p>

<p>By and by there came a time when Scott himself had
to go away on a trip into the Smoky Range, and which
would keep him from home a week. He left his wife
behind, as was his custom. He also left Alfred Baird
there&mdash;for Baird was still &#8220;boarding&#8221; at Scott&#8217;s.</p>

<p>When old Fred Scott came back, it was to find the
house in as perfect order as ever, with every little detail
of house work faithfully performed up to the last
moment of her staying, but the wife was gone. Neither
wife, nor the money&mdash;hidden away in an old powder-can
behind the corner cupboard&mdash;were there.</p>

<p>Both were gone&mdash;the woman and the gold pieces;
and it was characteristic of Old Scott that his first feelings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
of grief and rage were not for the loss of his wife,
but for the coins she had taken from the powder-can.
He was like a maniac&mdash;breaking everything he had
ever seen his wife use; tearing to pieces with his strong,
sinewy hands every article of her clothing his eyes fell
upon. He raved like a madman, and cursed like a fiend.
Then he found her letter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;Dear Fred:&mdash;</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;m a going away, and I&#8217;m a going to stay a
year. The money will last us two just about that long.
I asked Mr. Baird to go with me, so you needn&#8217;t blame
him. I ain&#8217;t got nothing against you, only you
wouldn&#8217;t never take me nowheres; and I just couldn&#8217;t
stand it no longer. I&#8217;ve been a good wife, and worked
hard, and earned money for you; but I ain&#8217;t never had
none of it myself to spend. So I&#8217;m a going to have it
now; for some of it is mine anyway. It has been work&mdash;work
all the time, and you wouldn&#8217;t take me nowheres.
So I&#8217;m a going now myself. I don&#8217;t like Mr.
Baird better than I do you&mdash;that ain&#8217;t it&mdash;and if you
want me to come back to you in a year I will. And I&#8217;ll
be a good wife to you again, like I was before. Only
you needn&#8217;t expect for me to say that I&#8217;ll be sorry because
I done it, for I won&#8217;t be. I won&#8217;t never be sorry
I done it; never, never! So, good-by.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Your loving wife,</span><br />

Martha J. Scott.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>If, through the long years, he had not been blind,
he could have saved her from it. Not a vicious woman&mdash;not
a wantonly sinning woman; only one who&mdash;weak
and ignorant&mdash;was dazed and bewildered by the
possibilities she saw in just one year of unrestricted
freedom to enjoy all the pleasures that might come
within her reach.</p>

<p>To be sure, it did seem preposterous that a young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
and handsome man, with refined tastes and education,
should go away with a woman years older than himself,
and one, too, who was uncouth in manner and in
speech. However strange it looked to the world, the
fact remained that they eloped. But both were well
away before it was suspected that they had gone together.
Old Scott volunteered no information to the
curious; and his grim silence forbade the questions
they would have asked. It was long before the truth
was known, for people were slow to credit so strange a
story.</p>

<p>The two were seen in San Francisco one day as
they were buying their tickets on the eve of sailing for
Honolulu. She looked very lovely, and was as tastefully
and becomingly gowned as any woman one might
see. Baird, no doubt, had seen to that; for he had exquisite
taste, and he was too wise to challenge adverse
criticism by letting her dress in the glaring colors and
startling styles she would have chosen, had she been
allowed to follow her own tastes. In her pretty, new
clothes, with her really handsome face all aglow from
sheer joy in the new life she was beginning, she looked
twenty years younger, and attracted general attention
because of her unusual eyes and her magnificently-colored
hair.</p>

<p>She was radiant with happiness; and there was no
apparent consciousness of wrong-doing. Baird always
showed a gracious deference to all women, and to her
he was devotion itself. The little attentions that will
charm and captivate any woman&mdash;attentions to which
she was so unused&mdash;fed her starved nature, and for the
time satisfied without sating her. They sailed for the
Islands, and were there a year. They kept to themselves,
seeking no acquaintance with those around them&mdash;living
but for one another. And those who saw them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
told they seemed thoroughly fond of each other. He
was too much in love with himself and the surroundings
which catered to his extravagant tastes, to have a
great love for any woman; and she was scarcely the
person, in spite of her beauty&mdash;the beauty of some magnificent
animal&mdash;to inspire lasting affection in a man
like Baird. He was shrewd enough to keep people at a
distance, for unless one entered into conversation with
her she might easily be taken for the really cultivated
woman she looked. Yet the refined and aesthetic side
of Alfred Baird&#8217;s nature&mdash;and there was such&mdash;much
have met with some pretty severe shocks during a
twelvemonth&#8217;s close companionship. Too indolent to
work to support himself, he bore (he felt, heroically)
any mortification he was subjected to, and was content
in his degradation. But the woman herself was intensely
happy; happier than, in all her dreary life, she
had ever dreamed that mortals could be. She was in
love with the beautiful new world, which was like a
dream of fairy-land after her sordid life in the desolate
valley. That Hawaiian year must have been a revelation
of hitherto unimagined things to her. Baird&#8217;s moral
sense was blunted by his past dissipations, but her
moral sense was simply undeveloped. In her ignorance
she had no definition of morality. The man was
nothing to her except as an accessory to the fascinating
life which she had allowed herself &#8220;while the money
lasted.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the twelve months were run she philosophically
admitted the end of it all, and parted with him&mdash;apparently&mdash;without
a pang. If, at the moment of
parting, any regrets were felt by either because of
the separation, it was he, not she, who would have
chosen to drift longer down the stream. The year
had run its course; she would again take up the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
life. This could not last. Perhaps&mdash;who knows?&mdash;in
time he might have palled on her. No doubt, in
time, his weak nature would have wearied her; her
own was too eager for strong emotions, to find in him
a fitting mate.</p>

<p>Whether, at the last, she wrote to her husband, or
if he came to her when the year came to its end, no
one knows. But one day the people of the desert
saw her back at the adobes on the bluff. She returned
as suddenly as she had disappeared.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She seems to have settled into the old groove again.
She moves in the same apathetic way as before the
stirring events of her life. In her letter she said she
would not be sorry. It is not probable that she ever was,
or ever will be; but neither is it likely that she has ever
seen the affair from the point of view a moralist
would take. Her limited intelligence only allowed
her to perceive the dreariness of her own poor life,
and when her longings touched no responsive chord
in the man whom she had married, she deliberately
took one year of her existence and hung its walls with
all the gorgeous tapestries and rich paintings that
could be wrought by the witchery of those magic
days in the Pacific.</p>

<p>Fires have burned as fiercely within that woman&#8217;s
breast as ever burned the fires of Kilauea; and when
they were ready to burst their bounds, she fled in her
impulse to the coral isles of the peaceful Western sea,
and there her ears heard the sound, and her heart
learned the meaning of words that have left no
visible sign upon her&mdash;the wondrous, sweet words
of a dream, whispered to her unceasingly, while she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
gave herself up to an enchantment as mad and
bewildering as that of the rhythmic hula-hula.</p>

<p>If she sinned, she does not seem to know it. Going
about at her work, as before, the expressionless face
is a mask; yet it may be she is moving in a dream-world,
wherein she lives over once again the months
that were hers&mdash;once&mdash;in the far Hawaiian Isles.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">AN OLD SQUAW</h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/s.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SHE had been lying by the stone wall all
day. And the sun was so hot that the
blood beating in her ears sounded like
the White Man&#8217;s fire-horse that had
just pulled a freight train into the station,
and was grunting and drinking
down at the water tank a hundred yards away. It
was getting all the water it wanted; why couldn&#8217;t she
have all the water she wanted, too?</p>

<p>Today they had brought her the tomato can only
half full. Such a little drink! And her mouth was
so hot and dry! They were starving her to death&mdash;had
been starving her for days and days. Oh, yes!
she knew what they were doing. She knew why they
were doing it, too. It was because she was in the way.</p>

<p>She was an old squaw. For weeks she had been half
dead; she had lain for weeks whimpering and moaning
in a corner of the camp on a heap of refuse and
rotting rags, where they had first shoved her aside
when she could no longer gather herself up on her
withered limbs and go about to wait upon herself.</p>

<p>They had cursed her for her uselessness; and had
let the children throw dirt at her, and take her scant
share of food away and give it to the dogs. Then
they had laughed at her when one of the older grandchildren
had spat at her; and when she had striven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
to strike at the mocking, devilish face, and in her
feebleness had failed, they had but laughed the louder
while she shrieked out in her hatred of them all.</p>

<p>Her children, and her children&#8217;s children&mdash;her
flesh and bone! They were young, and well, and
strong; and she was old, feeble and dying. Old&mdash;old&mdash;old!
Too old to work. Too old to do for herself any
longer, they were tired of her; and now they had put
her out of the wick-i-up to die alone there by the
stone wall. She knew it&mdash;knew the truth; but what
could she do?</p>

<p>She was only an old Paiute squaw.</p>

<p>At first they had given her half the amount of food
which they allowed her before she had grown so
feeble. Then it was but a quarter; and then again
it was divided in half. Now&mdash;at the last&mdash;they were
bringing her only water.</p>

<p>One day when she was faint and almost crazed from
hunger, one of the boys (her own son&#8217;s son) had come
with a meat bone and thrown it down before her; but
when she reached out with trembling, fleshless hands
to grasp it, he had jerked at the string to which it
was tied, and snatched it away. Again and again he
threw it toward her; again and again she tried to be
quick enough to close her fingers upon it before he
could jerk it from her. Then (when, at last, he was
tired of the play) he had flung it only an arm&#8217;s length
beyond her reach, and had run laughing down to the
railroad to beg nickels from the passengers on the
train. When he had gone a dog came and dropped
down beside her, and gnawed the bone where it lay.
She had crawled out into the sunshine that day, and
lay huddled in a heap close to the door-flap at the
wick-i-up entrance. The warm sunlight at first felt
good to her chilled blood, and she had lain there long;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
but finally when she would have dragged her feeble
body within again, a young squaw (the one who had
mated with the firstborn son, and was now ruler of
the camp) had thrust her back with her foot, and said
that her whining and crying were making the Great
Spirit angry; and that henceforth she must stay outside
the camp, for a punishment.</p>

<p>Ah, she knew! She knew! They could not deceive
her. It was not the Great Spirit that had put her
out, but her own flesh and blood. How she hated
them all! If she could only be young again she would
have them put to death, as she herself had had others
put to death when there were many to do her bidding.
But she was old; and she must lie outside, away from
those who had put her there to starve, while in the
gray dusk they gathered around the campfire and
ate, and laughed, and forgot her. She wished the
cool, dark night might last longer, with the sage-scented
winds from the plain blowing over her. But
morning would come with a blood-red sun shining
through the summer haze, and she would have to lie
there under the furnace heat through all the long daylight
hours, with only a few swallows of water
brought to her in the tomato can to quench her
intolerable thirst.</p>

<p>They were slowly starving her to death just because
she was old. They hated squaws when they got old.
They did not tell her so; but she knew. She, too,
had hated them once. That was long ago. Long,
long ago; when she was young, and strong, and swift.</p>

<p>She was straight then and good to look at. All of
the young men of her tribe had striven for her; and
two had fought long&mdash;had fought wildly and wickedly.
That was when the White Man had first come into
the country of her people, and they had fought with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
knives they had taken from the Whites. Knives
long, and shining, and sharp. They had fought and
slashed, and cut each other till the hard ground was
red and slippery where they stood. Then&mdash;still fighting&mdash;they
had fallen down, down; and where they
fell, they died. Died for her&mdash;a squaw! Well, what
of it, now? Tomorrow she, too, would die. She whom
they, and others, had loved.</p>

<p>Once, long ago&mdash;long before the time when she had
become Wi-o-chee&#8217;s wife&mdash;at the Fort on the other
side of the mountain, where the morning sun comes
first, there had been a White Man whose eyes were
the blue of the soldier-blue he wore; and whose mustache
was yellow like the gold he wore on his shoulders.</p>

<p>He, too, was young, and straight, and strong; and
one day he had caught her in his arms and held her
while he kissed her on mouth and eyes, and under her
little round chin. And when she had broken away
from him and had run&mdash;run fast as the deer runs&mdash;he
had called after her: &#8220;Josie! Josie! Come back!&#8221;
But she had run the faster till, by and by, when he
had ceased calling, she had stolen back and had thrown
a handful of grass at him as he sat, with bowed head,
on the doorstep of the officers&#8217; quarters; his white
fingers pressed tight over his eyelids. Then when he
had looked up she had gone shyly to him, and put her
hand in his. And when he stood up, looking eagerly
in her eyes, she had thrown her head back, where she
let it lay against his arm, and laughed, showing the
snow-white line of her teeth, till he was dazzled by
what he saw and hid the whiteness that gleamed
between her lips by the gold that swept across his
own.</p>

<p>That was long ago. Not yesterday, nor last week,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
nor last month; but so long ago that it did not even
awaken in her an interest in remembering how he had
taught her English words to say to him, and laughed
with her when she said them so badly.</p>

<p>She did not care about it, at all, now. She only
wanted a drink of water; and her children would not
give her what she craved.</p>

<p>Always, she had been brave. She had feared nothing&mdash;nothing.
She could ride faster, run farther, dare
more than other young squaws of the tribe. She had
been stronger and suppler. Yet today she was dying
here by the stone wall&mdash;put out of the camp by her
children&#8217;s children to die.</p>

<p>She would die tomorrow; or next day, at latest.
Perhaps tonight. She had thought she was to die last
night when the lean coyote came and stood off from
her, and watched with hungry eyes. All night he
watched. Going away, and coming back. Coming
and going all night. All night his little bright eyes
shone like stars. And the stars, too, watched her
there dying for water and meat, but they handed
nothing down to her from the cool sky.</p>

<p>Oh, for strength again! For life, and to be young!
But she was old and weak. She would die; and when
she was dead they would take her in her rags, and&mdash;winding
the shred of a gray blanket about her (the
blanket on which she lay)&mdash;they would tie it tightly
at her head and at her feet; and so she would be
made ready for her last journey.</p>

<p>Dragging her to a waiting pony she would be laid
across the saddle, face down. To the stirrups, which
would be tied together beneath the horse that they
might not swing, her head and feet would be fastened&mdash;her
head at one stirrup, her feet at the other.</p>

<p>Then they would lead the pony off through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
greasewood. Along the stony trail across the upland
to the foothills the little buckskin pony would pick
his way, stumbling on the rocks while his burden
would slip and shake about, lying across the saddle.
Then they would lay her in a shallow place, and
heaping earth and gravel over her, would come away.
That was the way they had done with her mother,
with Wi-o-chee, and the son who had died.</p>

<p>Tomorrow&mdash;yes, tomorrow&mdash;they would take her to
the foothills. Perhaps the coyote would go there
tomorrow night; would go there, and dig.</p>

<p>He had come now, and stood watching her from
the shelter of the sagebrush. He was afraid to come
nearer&mdash;now. She was too weak to move even a
finger today, yet he was afraid. He would not come
close till she was dead. He knew.</p>

<p>Once he walked a few steps toward her, watching
her all the while with his little cruel eyes. Then he
turned and trotted back into the sagebrush. He knew.
Not yet.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All day the sun had lain in heavy heat on the tangle
of vile rags by the stone wall. All day the magpie,
hopping along the wall, watched with head bent sidewise
at the rags that only moved with the faint breathing
of the body beneath. All day long two buzzards
far up in the still air swung slowly in great circling
sweeps. All day, from early dawn till dusk, a brown
hand&mdash;skinny and foully dirty&mdash;clutched the tomato
can; but the can today had been left empty. Forgotten.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>When it grew dark and a big, bright star glowed
in the West, the coyote came out of the shadows of
the sagebrush and stood looking at the tangled rags
by the stone wall.</p>

<p>Only a moment he stood there. He threw up his
head, and his voice went out in a chilling call to his
mate. Then with lifted lip he walked quickly forward.
He was no longer afraid.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;YES, you&#8217;re right, Sid; in these days of
multi-millionaires, nothing that is written
with less than eight figures is considered
&#8216;wealth.&#8217; Yet, even so, I count
this something more than a &#8216;tidy little
sum&#8217; you&#8217;ve cleaned up&mdash;even if you do
not. And now tell me, what are you going to do
with it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man sitting at the uncovered pine table in the
center of the room opened his lips to answer, checked
himself as if doubtful of the reception of what he
might say, and then went on nervously sorting and
rearranging the handful of papers and letters which
he held. However, the light that came into his eyes
at Keith&#8217;s question, and the smile that played around
his weak lips, showed without a doubt that the &#8220;tidy
little sum&#8221; promised to him at least the fulfillment
of unspoken dreams.</p>

<p>He was a handsome man of thirty&mdash;a man of
feminine beauty rather than that which is masculine.
And though dressed in rough corduroys and flannels,
like his companion, they added to, rather than
detracted from his picturesque charm. Slightly&mdash;almost
delicately proportioned, he seemed to be taller
than he really was. In spite of his great beauty, however,
his face was not a satisfying one under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
scrutiny of a close observer, for it lacked character.
There was refinement and a certain sweetness of temperament
there, but the ensemble was essentially
weak&mdash;it was the face of a man of whom one felt it
would not be well for any believing, loving woman
to pin her faith to.</p>

<p>Keith, sitting with his long legs crossed and his
big, strong hands thrust deep into his trousers&#8217;
pockets, watched the younger man curiously, wondering
what manner of woman she could have been
who had chosen Sidney Williston for her lord and
master.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor little neglected woman,&#8221; thought Keith, with
that tender and compassionate feeling he had for
every feminine and helpless thing; &#8220;poor little
patiently waiting wife! Will he ever go back to her,
I wonder? I doubt it. And now to think of all this
money!&#8221;</p>

<p>Williston had said but little to Keith about his wife.
In fact, all reference to her very existence had been
avoided when possible. Keith even doubted if his
friend would ever again recognize the marriage tie
between them unless the deserted one should unexpectedly
present herself in person and claim her
rights. Williston&mdash;vacillating, unstable&mdash;was the
kind of a man in whom loyalty depends on the presence
of its object as a continual reminder of obligations.
Keith was sure, however, that the woman,
whoever she might be, was more than deserving of
pity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sidney means well,&#8221; thought Keith trying to find
excuse for him, &#8220;but he is weak&mdash;lamentably so&mdash;and
sadly lacking in moral balance.&#8221; And never had
Williston been so easily lead, so subservient to the
will of another as now, since &#8220;that cursed Howard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
woman&#8221; (as Keith called her under his breath) had
got him into her toils.</p>

<p>Lovesick as any boy he was befooled to his heart&#8217;s
content, wilfully blind to the fact that it was the
old pitiful story of a woman&#8217;s greed, and that her
white hands had caresses and her lips kisses for his
gold&mdash;not for himself. Her arms were eager to hold
in their clasp&mdash;not him, but&mdash;the great wealth which
was his, the gold which had come from the fabulously
rich strike he had cleaned up on the bedrock of the
claim, where a cross reef had held it hidden a thousand
years and more. Her red lips were athirst to
lay kisses&mdash;&mdash; On his mouth? Nay! on the piles
of minted gold that had lain in the bank vault since
he had sold his mine. The Twentieth Century Aspasia
has a hundred arts her sister of old knew naught of;
and Williston was not the first man who has unwittingly
played the part of proxy to another, or blissfully
believed in the lying lips whose kisses sting like
the sting of wild bees&mdash;those honey-sweet kisses that
stab one&#8217;s soul with needles of passionate pain. All
these were for the gold-god, not him; he was but the
unconscious proxy.</p>

<p>Keith mused on the situation as he sat in the flickering
candle-light blown by the night wind that&mdash;coming
in through the open window&mdash;brought with it the
pungent odor of sagebrush-covered hills.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strange,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;how a woman of that particular
stamp gets a hold on some fellows! And with
a whole world full of other women, too&mdash;sweet, good
women who are ready to give a man the right sort
of love and allegiance, if he&#8217;s a half-way decent sort
of a fellow with anything at all worthy to give in
exchange; God bless &#8217;em!&mdash;and confound him! He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
makes me angry; why can&#8217;t he pull himself together
and be a man!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bayard Keith was no saint. Far from it. Yet, for
all his drifting about the world, he had kept a pretty
clean and wholesome moral tone. Women of the
Gloria Howard class did not appeal to his taste; that
was all there was about it. But he knew men a-plenty
who, for her sake, would have committed almost any
crime in the calendar if she set it for them to do.
There were men who would have faced the decree of
judge and jury without a tremor, if the deed was done
for her sake. He himself could not understand such
things. Not that he felt himself better or stronger
than his fellows; it was simply that he was made of
a different sort of stuff.</p>

<p>Yet, in spite of his manifest indifference to the
charm of her large, splendid beauty&mdash;dazzling as the
sun at noon-day&mdash;and that marked personality which
all others who ever came within the circle of her
presence seemed to feel, Keith knew he could have
this woman&#8217;s love for the asking&mdash;the love of a woman
who, &#8217;twas said, won love from all, yet giving love
to none. Nay, but he knew it was already his. His
very indifference had fanned a flame in her breast;
a flame which had been lit as her eyes were first lifted
to his own and she beheld her master, and burning
steadily it had become the consuming passion of this
strange creature&#8217;s existence. Hopeless, she knew it
was; yet it was stronger than her love of life. Even
stronger than her inordinate love of money was this
passion for the man whose heart she had utterly
failed to touch.</p>

<p>That he must know it to be so, was but an added
pain for her fierce nature to bear. Keith wondered
if Williston had ever suspected, as she played her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
part, the woman&#8217;s passionate and genuine attachment
to himself. He hoped not, for the two men had been
good comrades, though without the closer bond of a
fine sympathy; and Keith&#8217;s wish was that their comradeship
should continue, while he hoped the woman&#8217;s
love, in time, would wear itself out. To Williston
he had once tried to give a word of advice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drop it, Keith,&#8221; came the quick answer to his
warning, &#8220;I love her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Granted that you do, why should you so completely
enslave yourself to a woman of that type?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by &#8216;that type?&#8217; Take care!
take care, Keith! I tell you I love her! Were I not
already a married man I would make Mrs. Howard
my wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, you wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; Keith answered quietly.
&#8220;Howard refuses to get a divorce, and you know
very well she cannot. Besides, Sid, it would be sheer
madness for you to do such a thing, even were she
free.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It makes no difference; I love her,&#8221; was again
the reply, and said with the childish persistence of
those with whom reiteration takes the place of argument.</p>

<p>Keith said no more, though he felt the shame of it
that Sidney Williston&#8217;s fortune should be squandered
on another woman, while&mdash;somewhere off there in the
East&mdash;his wife waited for him to send for her. Keith&#8217;s
shoulders shrugged with impatience over the whole
pitiful affair. He was disgusted at Williston&#8217;s lack
of principle and angered by his disregard of public
censure. However, he reflected, trying to banish all
thoughts of it, it was none of his business; he was
not elected to be his brother&#8217;s keeper in this affair
surely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>As for himself, he believed the only love worth having
was that upon which the foundation of the
hearthstone was laid. He believed, too, that to no
man do the gods bring this priceless treasure more
than once. When a man like Keith believes this, it
becomes his religion.</p>

<p>Through the gateway to his big, honest heart, one
summer in the years gone by, love had entered, and&mdash;finding
it the dwelling of honor and truth&mdash;it
abided there still.</p>

<p>Thinking of Williston&#8217;s infatuation for Gloria
Howard, he could but compare it to his own entire,
endless love for Kathryn Verrill. He recalled a day
that would always stand out in bold relief from all
others in memory&#8217;s gallery.</p>

<p>In fancy now he could see the wide veranda built
around one of the loveliest summer homes of the beautiful
Thousand Islands. Cushions&mdash;soft and silken&mdash;lay
tossed about on easy chairs and divans that were
scattered about here and there among tubs of palms
and potted plants. On little tables up and down the
veranda&#8217;s length were summer novels open and face
downward as their readers had left them, or dainty
and neglected bits of fancy-work. Cooling drinks and
dishes of luscious fruits had been placed there within
their reach. Keith closed his eyes with a sigh, as the
memory of it all came back to him. Here, amid the
sage and desert sands, it was like a dream of lost
Paradise.</p>

<p>It had been a day of opalescent lights, and through
its translucence they (he and&mdash;she) could see the rest
of the party on the sparkling waters, among the pleasure
craft from other wooded islands, full of charm,
near by. Only these two&mdash;he and she&mdash;were here on
the broad veranda. The echo of distant laughter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
came to them, but here was a languorous silence.
Even the yellow-feathered warblers in the gilded cages
above them had, for the time, hushed their songs.</p>

<p>Kathryn Verrill was swinging slowly back and
forth in one of the hammocks swung along the veranda,
the sunlight filtering through the slats of the
lowered blinds streaking with gold her filmy draperies
as they swept backward and forward on the polished
floor. Her fingers had ceased their play on the mandolin
strings, and there was now no sound about
them louder than the hum of the big and gorgeous
bumble-bee buzzing above their heads. Summer sweetness
anywhere, and she the sweetest of it all!
Then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Ah, well! He had asked her to marry him, and
the pained look that came into her face was his
answer even before he heard her say that for two
years she had been another&#8217;s&mdash;a secretly-wedded wife.
Why she should now tell her carefully guarded
secret to him she herself could hardly have told. No
one else knew. Her husband had asked that it should
be their dear secret until he could send for her to
come to him out in the land of the setting sun, where
he had gone alone in the hope that he would find
enough of the yellow metal grains so that he could
provide her with a fitting home. Her guardian had
not liked the man of her choice&mdash;had made objections
to his attentions. Then there was the clandestine
marriage. And then he had gone away to make a
home for her. But she loved him; oh, yes! he was
her choice of all the world, her hero always&mdash;her
husband now. She was glad to have done as she did&mdash;there
was nothing to regret, except the enforced
separation. So she was keeping their secret while
feeding her soul with the hope of reunion that his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
rare letters brought. But she had faith. Some day&mdash;some
day he would win the fortune that would pave
the way to him; then he would send for her. Some
day. And she was waiting. And she loved him;
loved him. That was all.</p>

<p>All, except that she was sorry for Keith, as all good
women are sorry to hurt any human creature. No
loyal, earnest, loving man ever offers his whole heart
to any true and womanly woman (it matters not how
little her own affections are moved by his appeal, or
if they be stirred at all) that she does not feel touched
and honored by the proffered gift. Womanly sympathy
looked out of her gentle eyes, but she had for
him no slightest feeling of other attraction. Keith
gravely accepted his fate; but he knew that Love
(that beautiful child born of Friendship&mdash;begot by
Passion) would live forever in the inner chamber of
his heart. To him, Kathryn Verrill would always be
the one woman in all the world.</p>

<p>He went out of her life and back to the business
routine of his own. In work he would try to forget
his wounds. Later there were investments that turned
out badly, and he lost heavily&mdash;lost all.</p>

<p>Then he came West. Here, in the Nevada mountains,
he had found companionship in Sidney Williston
who, like himself, was a seeker for gold. A general
similarity of tastes brought about by their former
ways of living (for Williston, too, was an eastern man)
had been the one reason for each choosing the companionship
of the other. So, here in the paintless
pine cabin in Porcupine Gulch, each working his
separate claim, they had been living under the same
roof for nearly two years; but Fate, that sees fit to
play us strange tricks sometimes, had laid a fortune
in Williston&#8217;s hands, while Keith&#8217;s were yet empty.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>Sidney Williston&#8217;s silence, when asked what he
would do with his wealth, was answer enough. It
would be for Gloria Howard. There he sat now,
thinking of her&mdash;planning for her.</p>

<p>Millers, red-winged moths and flying ants fluttered
around the candle, blindly batting at the burning
wick and falling with singed wings on the table. The
wind was rising again, and the blaze at times was
nearly snuffed out, moth-beaten and blown by the
strong breeze.</p>

<p>All the morning the sun had laid its hot hand
heavily on the earth between the places where dense
white clouds hung without a motion in the breathless
sky. The clouds had spread great dark shadows on
the cliffs below, where they clung to the rocks like
time-blackened and century-old lichens. But in the
shadowless spots the sun&#8217;s rays were intensely hot,
as they so often are before a coming storm; while the
fierce heat for the time prostrated plant-life, and sent
the many tiny animals of the hills to those places
where the darkest shadows lay. Flowers were wilting
where they grew. White primroses growing in the
sandy soil near the cabin had but the night before
lifted their pale, sweet faces to the moon&#8217;s soft light&mdash;lovely
evening primroses growing straight and strong.
Noonday saw them drooping weakly on their stalks,
blushing a rosy, shamed pink; kissed into color by
the amorous caresses of that rough lover, the Sun.
Night would find them faded and unlovely, their purity
and sweetness ruthlessly wrested from them forever.</p>

<p>As the sun climbed to the zenith, there was not the
slightest wind stirring; the terrible heat lay, fold on
fold, upon the palpitating earth. But noon came and
brought a breeze from out of the south. Stronger
and stronger it swept toward the blue mountains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
lying away to the northward. It gathered up sand
particles and dust, and shook them out into the air
till the sunlight was dulled, and the great valley
below showed through a mist of gold. All the afternoon
the atmosphere was oppressively hot, while the
wind hurried over valley and upland and mountain.
All the afternoon the dust storm in billowy clouds
hurried on, blowing&mdash;blowing&mdash;blowing. A whistling
wind it was, keeping up its mournful song in the
cracks of the unpainted cabin, and whipping the burlap
awning over the door into ragged shreds at the
edges. The dark green window shades flapped and
rattled their length, carried out level from their fastenings
by the force of the hot in-blowing wind.</p>

<p>Then with the down-going of the sun the wind died
down also. When twilight came, the heavens were
overcast with rain-clouds that told of a hastening
storm which would leave the world fresh and cool
when it had passed. The horizon line was brightened
now and again by zigzags of lightning. Inside the
cabin the close air was full of dust particles.</p>

<p>Sidney Williston tossed a photograph across the
table, as he gathered his papers together preparatory
to putting them away.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s my wife&#8217;s picture, Keith,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I
don&#8217;t think I ever showed it to you, did I?&#8221;</p>

<p>Keith got up&mdash;six feet, and more, of magnificent
manhood; tall, he was, and straight as a pine, and
holding his head in kingly wise. Leisurely he walked
across the bare floor, which echoed loudly to his tread;
leisurely he picked it up.</p>

<p>It was the pictured face of Kathryn Verrill!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He did not say anything; neither did he move....
If you come to think of it, those who sustain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
great shocks seldom do anything unusual except in
novels. In real life people cry out and exclaim over
trifles; but let a really stupendous thing happen, and
you may be very sure that they will be proportionately
silent. The mind, incapable of instantly grasping the
magnitude of what has happened, makes one to stand
immovable and in silence.</p>

<p>Keith said nothing. His breathing was quite as
regular as usual, and his grasp on the picture was
firm&mdash;untrembling. Yet in that instant of time he
had received the greatest shock of his life, and
myriad thoughts were running through his brain with
the swiftness of the waters in the mining sluice. He
held the bit of pasteboard so long that Williston at
last looked up at him inquiringly.</p>

<p>When he handed it back his mind was made up.
He knew what must be done. He knew what he must
do&mdash;at once&mdash;for her sake.</p>

<p>When two or three hours later he heard Williston&#8217;s
regular breathing coming from the bed across the
room, he stole out in the darkness to the shed where
the horses and buckboard were. It was their one
vehicle of any sort, and the only means they had of
reaching the valley. With the team gone, Williston
would practically be a prisoner for several days.
Keith had no hesitation in deciding which way his
duty lay. It was thirty miles to the nearest town; to
the telegraph; to Gloria Howard; to the railroad!</p>

<p>As he pulled the buckboard out of the shed and
put the horses before it, the first raindrops began to
fall. Big splashing drops they were, puncturing the
parched dust as they beat down upon it. Flashes of
lightning split the heavens, and each flash made the
earth&mdash;for the instant&mdash;noon-bright. When he had
buckled the last strap his hands tightened on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
reins, and he swung himself up to the seat as the
thunder&#8217;s batteries were turned loose on the earth in
a tremendous volley that set the very ground trembling.
The frightened horses, crouching, swerved aside
an instant, and then leaped forward into the darkness.
Along the winding road they swept, like part
of the wild storm, toward the town that lay off in
the darkness of the valley below.</p>

<p>It was past midnight, and thirty miles lay between
him and the railroad. There was no time to spare.
He drove the horses at a pace which kept time with
his whirlwind thoughts and his pulses.</p>

<p>He had been cool and his thoughts had been collected
when under another&#8217;s possible scrutiny. Now,
alone, with the midnight storm about him, his brain
was whirling, and a like storm was coursing through
his veins.</p>

<p>The crashing thunder that had seemed like an
avalanche of boulders shattered and flung earthward
by the fury of the storm, began to spend itself, and
close following on the peals and flashes came the
earth-scent of rain-wetted dust as the big drops came
down. By and by the thunder died away in distant
grumbling, and the fiery zigzags went out. There
was the sound of splashing hoofs pounding along the
road; and the warm, wet smell of horses&#8217; steaming
hides, blown back by the night wind.</p>

<p>Fifteen miles&mdash;ten&mdash;five miles yet to go. Not once
had Keith slackened speed.</p>

<p>When at length he found himself on the low levels
bordering the river, the storm had passed over, and
ere he reached the town the rain had ceased falling.
A dim light was breaking through the darkness in
places, and scudding clouds left rifts between which
brilliant stars were beginning to shine.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>As he drove across the bridge and into the lower
town, he woke the echoes of a watch-dog&#8217;s barking;
otherwise, the town was still. At the livery stable
he roused the sleeping boy, who took his team; and
flinging aside the water-soaked great-coat he wore, he
walked rapidly toward the railroad station at the
upper end of the town. The message he wrote was
given to the telegraph operator with orders to
&#8220;rush.&#8221; It read:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have found the fortune. Now I want my
wife. Come.&#8221;</p>

<p>He signed it with Sidney Williston&#8217;s name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Number Two on time?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;An hour late. It&#8217;ll be here about 4:10,&#8221; was the
reply.</p>

<p>Leaving the office, he went back to the lower town.
Down the hill and past the pleasant cottages half
hidden under their thick poplar shade, and surrounded
by neat, close-trimmed lawns. Leaf and
grass-blade had been freshened by the summer storm;
and the odor of sweet garden flowers&mdash;verbenas,
mignonette and pinks&mdash;was wafted strongly to his
nostrils on the night air. They were homes. He
turned away from all the fragrance and sighed&mdash;the
sigh of renunciation. Crickets were beginning to
trill their night songs. Past the court-house he went,
where it stood ghostly and still in the darkness; past
the business buildings farther down, glistening with
wet. He turned into a side street to the house where
he had been told Gloria Howard lived. At the gate
he hesitated a moment, then opening it, went inside.
Stepping off the graveled walk, his feet pressed noiselessly
into the rain-soaked turf as he turned a corner
of the cottage, and&mdash;going to a side window&mdash;rapped
on the casing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>There was silence, absolute and deep. Again he
rapped. Sharply this time; and he softly called her
name twice. He heard a startled movement in the
room, then a pause, as though she were listening. A
moment later her white gown gleamed against the
darkness of the bedchamber, and she stood at the
open window under its thick awning of green hop
vines. Her face was on a level with his own. Her
hair exhaled the odor of violets. He could hear her
breathing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gloria,&#8221;&mdash;&mdash;he began, softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you&mdash;&mdash;what is it?&#8221; Then, &#8220;Keith!
You!&#8221; she exclaimed; and in a moment more flung
wide the wire screen that had divided them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh!&#8221;&mdash;&mdash;he whispered. &#8220;I want to speak to
you. But&mdash;&mdash;hark! listen!&#8221; He laid his hand
lightly on her lips.</p>

<p>She caught it quickly between both her own, and
laid a hot cheek against it for an instant; then she
pressed it tightly against her heart.</p>

<p>The night watchman patrolling the streets was passing;
and they stood&mdash;he and she together&mdash;without
movement, in the moist, dusky warmth of the rain-washed
summer night, until the footsteps echoed
faintly on the wet boards half a block away; the
sound mingling with the croaking of the river frogs.
Keith could feel the fast beating of her heart. The
wet hop leaves shook down a shower of drops as they
were touched by a passing breeze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gloria,&#8221;&mdash;&mdash;he spoke rapidly, but scarcely above
his breath&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;I am going away tonight&mdash;&mdash;(he
felt her start) away from this part of the country
forever; and I have come to ask you to go with me.
Will you? Tell me, Gloria, will you go?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>She did not reply, but laying a hand on his still
damp coat-sleeve, tried to draw him closer, leaning
her face towards his, and striving to read in his own
face the truth of his words.</p>

<p>Had there been light enough for him to see, he
would have marvelled at the varying expressions that
followed in quick succession across her face. Surprise,
incredulity, wonderment, a dawning of the real meaning
of his words, triumph as she heard, and then&mdash;finally&mdash;a
look of fierce, absorbing, tigerish love. For
whatever else there might be to her discredit, her
love for him was no lie in her life. She had for this
man a passion as strong as her nature was intense.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gloria, Gloria, tell me! Will you leave all&mdash;everything
and everybody&mdash;and go away with me?&#8221; he
demanded impatiently. &#8220;Number Two is late&mdash;an
hour late tonight, and you will have time to make
yourself ready if you hasten. Come, Gloria, come!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do&mdash;&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;mean&mdash;&mdash;it, Bayard Keith?&#8221; she breathed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean it. Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>She knew his yea was yea; still she missed a certain
quality in what he said&mdash;a certain something (she
could not say what) in his tone.</p>

<p>She inhaled a long breath as she drew away
from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a strange man&mdash;a very, very strange man.
Do you know it? All these many months you have
shunned me; yet now you ask me to cast my lot with
yours. Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I find I want you&mdash;at last.&#8221;</p>

<p>His answer seemed to satisfy her.</p>

<p>&#8220;For how long?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>Just for the imperceptible part of a second he hesitated.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
His answer would be another unbreakable
link in the chain he was forging for himself. Only
the fraction of a second, though, he paused. Then
his reply came, firm and decided:</p>

<p>&#8220;Forever, Gloria, if you will have it so.&#8221;</p>

<p>For answer she dropped her head on her folded
arms while a dry, hard sob forced its way through
her lips. It struck upon the chord within him that
always thrilled to the sight or sound of anything,
even remotely, touching grief. This sudden, unexpected
joy of hers was so near akin to sorrow&mdash;ay,
and she had had much sorrow, God knows! in her misspent
life&mdash;it was cause enough for calling forth the
gentle touch he laid upon her bowed head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, Gloria, girl! Don&#8217;t! It isn&#8217;t worth this,
believe me. Yet, if you come, you shall never have
cause for regret, if there&#8217;s anything left in a man&#8217;s
honor.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stroked her hair silently a moment before he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;There are some things yet to be done before train
time; so I must go now. Will you be there&mdash;at the
station?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>So it was that the thing was settled; and Keith
accepted his fate in silence.</p>

<p>An evil thing done? Perhaps. Evil, that good
might come of it. And he himself to be the sole
sufferer. He was removing this woman beyond Sidney
Williston&#8217;s reach forever. When the weak, erring
husband should find himself free once more from the
toils which had held him, his love (if love it was)
would return to the neglected wife; and she, dear,
faithful, loving woman that she was, would never,
thank heaven! guess his unfaithfulness.</p>

<p>Bayard Keith did not feel himself to be a hero.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
Such men as he are never vainglorious; and Keith
had no thought of questioning Life&#8217;s way of spelling
&#8220;duty&#8221; as he saw it written. He was being loyal
for the sake of loyalty, a sacrifice for love&#8217;s own sake
than which no man can make greater, for he knew
that his martyrdom would be in forever being misjudged
by the woman for whose dear sake it was done.
He would be misjudged, of course, by Sidney Williston,
and by all the world, for that matter; but for
them he did not care. He was simply doing what he
thought was right that he himself should do&mdash;for
Kathryn Verrill&#8217;s sake. Her love had been denied
him. Now he must even forfeit her respect. All for
love&#8217;s sake. None must ever know why he had done
this hideous thing. They must be made to think that
he&mdash;like others&mdash;had yielded to a mad love for the
bad, beautiful woman. In his very silence under
condemnation lay security for Kathryn Verrill&#8217;s
happiness. Only he himself would ever know how
great would be his agony in bearing the load he had
undertaken. Oh, if there might be some other way
than this! If there could be but some still unthought-of
means of escape whereby he could serve his dear
lady, and yet be freed from yoking his life with a
woman from whom his whole being would revolt.
How would he be able through all the years to come&mdash;years
upon years&mdash;to bear his life, with her?</p>

<p>As he walked past the darkened buildings he
breathed heavily, each breath indrawn with a sibilant
sound, like a badger at bay. Yet he had no thought
of turning aside from his self-imposed immolation.</p>

<p>No one was astir in the lower town, save himself
and the night watchman. Now and then he passed a
dim light burning&mdash;here a low-turned burner in store
or bank building; there the brighter glow of lamps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
behind the ground glass of some saloon door. Halfway
up the long street leading to the upper town he
heard the rumble of an incoming train. Was Number
Two on time, after all? Was a pitying Fate taking
matters away from him, and into its own hands? Was
escape being offered him?</p>

<p>If he hurried&mdash;if he ran&mdash;he could reach the station
in time, but&mdash;alone! There would be no time to
go back for Gloria Howard. He almost yielded for a
moment to the coward&#8217;s impulse to shrink from responsibility,
but the thought of Kathryn Verrill, waiting
by the eastern sea for a message to come from the
man she loved, roused him to his better self. He
resolutely slackened his pace till the minutes had
gone by wherein he could have become a deserter; then
he went on up to the station.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that was a freight train that just pulled out,&#8221;
said the telegraph operator. &#8220;Number Two will be
here pretty soon, though. Less&#8217;n half an hour. She&#8217;s
made up a little time now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keith went to the office counter and began to write.
It was not a long letter, but it told all there was
to say:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;Sid: I have wired to your wife to come to you,
and I have signed your name. By the time this
reaches you she will be on her way here. It will be
wiser, of course, for you to assume the sending of the
message, and to give her the welcome she will expect.
It will be wiser, too&mdash;if I may offer suggestions&mdash;to
travel about with her for a while; to go away from
this place, where she certainly would hear of your
unfaithfulness should she remain. Then go back with
her to your friends, and live out the balance of your
life, in the old home, as you ought. I know you will
feel I am not a fit one to preach, for I myself am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
going away tonight, taking Gloria Howard with me.
I know, too, how you will look at what I am doing;
but I have neither excuses nor explanations to offer.</p>

<p class="right">Bayard Keith.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>That was all.</p>

<p>When he had sealed and directed it, he went to
the livery stable and waked up Pete Dudley.</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, Pete,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I want you to do something
for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, Mr. Keith!&#8221; said Pete, rubbing his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a letter for Mr. Williston out at our camp
in Porcupine Gulch. I want you to take it to him,
and take the buckboard, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll go in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no! Listen! Not till day after tomorrow.
Wait, let me think&mdash;&mdash; You&#8217;d better wait a day
longer&mdash;&mdash;go the next day. Do you understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I savvy. Not till Friday. Take the letter
and the buckboard. Is that the racket?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s what I want, Pete. Here! Take them
to him without fail on Friday. Good-night, Pete.
Good bye!&#8221;</p>

<p>Keith walked back to the station and went in the
waiting-room, where he sat down. His heart felt as
heavy as lead. He had burned all his bridges behind
him, and it made his soul sick to contemplate the
long vista of the coming years.</p>

<p>As he sat there, the coward hope that she&mdash;Gloria&mdash;might
not come, shot up in his heart, trying to make
of him a traitor. He said to himself: &#8220;If&mdash;&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
Presently he heard the train whistle. He got up and
went to the door. He felt he was choking. Daylight
was coming fast; day-dawn in the eastern sky. The
town, rain-cleansed and freshened, would soon awake
and lift its face to the greeting of another morn.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>The ticket-office window was shoved up. It was
nearing train time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Mr. Keith, going away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I want a&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where to?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Keith did not answer. A ticket? One, or two?
If she should not come&mdash;&mdash; Was Fate&mdash;&mdash;? What
was he to do? But, no! Yet he hesitated, while the
man at the window waited his reply. Two tickets, or
only one? Or not any? Nay, but he must go; and
there must be two.</p>

<p>Then the train thundered into the station, and
almost at the same moment he heard, through the
sound made by the clanging bell, the rustle of a
woman&#8217;s rich garments. He turned. Gloria Howard
stood there, beautiful and eager, panting from her
hurried walk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where to?&#8221; repeated the man at the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;San Francisco&mdash;two tickets,&#8221; said Keith.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Two,&#8217; did you say?&#8221; asked the man, looking up
quickly at him and then glancing sideways at the
radiant, laughing woman who had taken her place
so confidently at Keith&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>Keith&#8217;s voice did not falter, nor did his eyes fall:</p>

<p>&#8220;Two.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the telegraph operator smiled to himself as he
shoved the tickets across the window sill. To him,
Keith was simply &#8220;Another one!&#8221; So, too, would
the world judge him after he was gone.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Bayard Keith was no saint; but as he crossed to the
cars in the waxing light of day-dawn, his countenance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
was transfigured by an indescribable look we do not
expect to see&mdash;ever&mdash;on the face of mortal man.</p>

<p>&#8220;For her dear sake!&#8221; he whispered softly to himself,
as he looked away to the reddening East&mdash;to
the eastward where &#8220;she&#8221; was. &#8220;For the sake of
the woman I love.&#8221;</p>

<p>And &#8220;greater love hath no man than this, that a
man lay down his life for his friends.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IN NANNA&#8217;S PALM</h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT all happened years ago. Before there
was any railroad; even before there were
any overland stages crossing the plains.
Only the emigrant teams winding slowly
down the valley on the road stretching
westward.</p>

<p>Some there were, though, that had worked their
way back from the Western sea, to stop at those
Nevada ca&ntilde;ons where there was silver to be had for
the delving.</p>

<p>The ca&ntilde;ons were beautiful with dashing, dancing
streams, and blossoming shrubbery, and thick-leafed
trees; and there grew up in the midst of these, tiny
towns that called themselves &#8220;cities,&#8221; where the
miners lived who came in with the return tide from
the West.</p>

<p>There in one of the busiest, prettiest mining camps
on a great mountain&#8217;s side, in one of the stone cabins
set at the left of the single long street, dwelt Tony
and his cousin Bruno&mdash;Italians, both. Bruno worked
in the mines; but Tony, owning an ox team, hauled
loads for the miners to and from the other settlements.
A dangerous calling it was in those days, because an
Indian in ambush had ever to be watched for when a
White Man came down from the ca&ntilde;ons to travel alone
through the valley.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>Tony was willing, however, to take risks. Teaming
brought him more money than anything else he
could do; and the more he earned, the sooner he
could go back to Nanna&mdash;to Nanna waiting for him
away on the other side of the world.</p>

<p>He and Bruno both loved her&mdash;had loved her ever
since the days when, long ago, in their childhood, they
had played at being lovers down among the fishing
boats drawn up on the beach of their beloved Italian
home. Black-browed Bruno had then quarreled with
him in jealous hatred time and again; but the little
Nanna (who loved peace, and to whom both playfellows
were dear) would kiss each and say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come! Let us play that you are my twin brothers,
and I your only sister!&#8221; And so harmony would be
restored.</p>

<p>Thus it went on, and at last they were no longer
little children, but men who love a woman as men
may love. And Bruno&#8217;s parents came to the father
and mother of Nanna and settled that their children
should be man and wife; so in that way Bruno was
made glad, and no longer jealous of Tony&mdash;poor
Tony, who had not a single small coin that he could
call his own. Yet it was Tony whom Nanna loved&mdash;Tony
whose wife she wanted to be. But what can a
young girl do when the one she loves is poor, and
there is another whom her parents have chosen for
her who has a little farm promised him by his father
the day he shall bring home the wife they would
have him marry? Nanna neither resisted nor
rebelled; but only went to Tony who was as helpless
as herself, and there against his breast wept her
heart out.</p>

<p>It was only when Bruno declared that he was going
to America to make a great deal of money (saying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
that the farm was not enough&mdash;that when he and
Nanna were married he wanted they should be rich)
that a ray of hope shone for Tony.</p>

<p>&#8220;I, too, will go to America,&#8221; Tony whispered to
Nanna, &#8220;and perhaps there I also may find a fortune.
Then&mdash;when I come back&mdash;I may marry thee; may I
not, little dear one?&#8221;</p>

<p>And for answer, the little Nanna lifted her arms
to his neck and her lips to his own.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The night before the two men sailed away to the
strange, far-off land, Nanna and Tony walked together
under the oaks and ilexes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou wilt miss me, little one, but thou wilt be
true, I know. I shall think of thee all the time&mdash;every
hour. Thou wilt long for me, as I for thee. Thou
wilt miss my kisses; is it not so? But I&mdash;&mdash;! Ah,
Nanna! Nanna! Here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; And bowing over her
hand he pressed kiss after kiss in the upturned little
brown palm, closing her fingers tightly upon them as
he raised his head and smiled in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;There! These I give thee, sweet one, so that when
I am gone it shall be that thy Tony&#8217;s kisses are with
thee, and are thine whenever thou wilt.&#8221;</p>

<p>All the morrow, when the ship had sailed away,
Nanna lay on her cot up in the little whitewashed
bedroom under the eaves, and with lips pressed close
upon the palm that Tony&#8217;s lips had touched, sobbed
her grief out, till she sank into exhausted slumber.</p>

<p>One year; two years; three, came and went. Tony
off in America was making money, and soon he could
go home and they would be married in spite of her
parents or Bruno. The fourth year he wrote her how
the sum had grown&mdash;it was almost enough. Then she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
began checking off the months ere he would return
to her. Eighteen&mdash;sixteen&mdash;fourteen&mdash;now only
twelve months more! A year, and Tony would be
with her! Then half that year was gone. Six months,
only, to wait! Happy little Nanna! And Tony was
not less happy, away off there in his little stone
cabin in the mountains, or hauling goods for the
miners across the valley. His heart was so full of
her that&mdash;almost&mdash;he forgot to think of the Indians
when he was traveling along the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou art a fool,&#8221; said Bruno to him over and
over again. &#8220;Thou art a fool, indeed. It is more
money&mdash;this hauling&mdash;yes! But some day&mdash;ping!&mdash;and
it is the arrow of an Indian. Then what good
is it, the money? Thou art a fool, I say. As for
me, I will work here with the many in the mines.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bruno had just said this to him for the hundredth
time, as Tony was yoking his oxen for the long
journey up the wide valley to the North. And his
answer had been as always, that the saints would
protect him. Yet, should he not return the thirteenth
day, then indeed might Bruno think all was not well
with him, and could send some of the men from the
mines to go to him. He was not afraid, though.
Had not the saints protected him for nearly five
years? He was soon to go back to Italy, and (he
whispered to himself) to Nanna! So with a light
heart, and a laugh on his lip, he went down the
ca&ntilde;on beside the oxen, cracking his whip as he
warbled a song he and Nanna had sung together when
they had played by the boats and among the fishing
nets in the long, long ago.</p>

<p>The wagon jolted and rattled on its way down the
rocky road to the plain; and Tony&#8217;s big, beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
St. Bernard dog, Bono, followed in the dust sent
skyward by the heavy wheels as they came upon the
softer earth of the lowlands.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Everyone was Tony&#8217;s friend in the little mining
town. Therefore everyone was anxious when the
thirteenth day came, yet not Tony. With few words
(at such times such men do not say much) they
selected a dozen from among the town&#8217;s bravest and
best, and with heavy hearts set out on their journey
that was to follow Tony&#8217;s trail till they should find him.</p>

<p>Down into the hot valley&mdash;a-quiver under the summer
heat, over a road of powdered alkali, along the
Humboldt&#8217;s banks&mdash;through mile after mile of sagebrush
and greasewood&mdash;under the glaring, white sun,
they rode two and two. And so riding they spoke
seldom.</p>

<p>When they were nearing the place they knew Tony
must have reached the third day out (now more than
ten days gone) they saw outlined against the blue&mdash;high,
high in the air&mdash;circling spots of black. Dark
things that swept with a majesty of motion that was
appalling. Round and round, in great curves half a
mile wide, they swam through the ether, and dipped
and tilted without so much as the quiver of a wing
or other motion than that given by their marvelous
self-poise; sailing through mid-air as only a vulture
can.</p>

<p>They swept and circled over a spot that was awful
in its silence under the metallic brightness of the hot
August sun. The men looked at each other; looked
without speaking&mdash;for they understood. So without
speech they rode on to the place where the warped
irons from the burned wagon lay, and where a gaunt,
nearly starved St. Bernard howled over something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
that had once been his master. He had guarded the
dead man through ten hot days&mdash;through ten long
nights. Bono&#8217;s wail sounded long and mournful
through the narrow pass where the whistling arrows
had found them. Tony had never been neglectful
before, and the dog could not understand it.</p>

<p>Alas, poor Tony!</p>

<p>When Bruno went back to Italy that fall he told
Nanna that Tony was dead. And Nanna who came
of a race more or less stoical in time of stress did not
cry out, but simply shut her sorrow up close in her
heart where the others could not see. It had been
their secret&mdash;hers and Tony&#8217;s&mdash;and they had guarded
it well. Henceforth it would be hers alone. So she
gave no sign except such as she might for an old
playmate&#8217;s death.</p>

<p>By and by she married Bruno. What would you?
Her father and mother wished it; Bruno loved her;
he had money now to provide well for a wife; and
there was the little farm that his parents would give
him the day when he should bring home his bride.
So, after the manner of her kind, she finally yielded
to his wooing; and one day they were wed in the
little church on the hill where they had both been
christened when babies.</p>

<p>She bore him children, and was a good mother&mdash;a
good wife. She lived to be an old woman, and her
hair grew streaked with gray; yet to the last day of
her life she had a way of falling asleep with the
fingers of her left hand slipped under her cheek, and
her lips touching the upturned palm.</p>

<p>It was her one disloyalty to Bruno.</p>

<p>And so it was they found her lying on that morning
that she did not waken.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE VENGEANCE OF LUCAS</h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/t.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE little adobe house stood flush with
the street, halfway between the business
houses and the residence portion of the
town which turned its back on the sand
and sage-covered hills that&mdash;breaking
into gray waves&mdash;far off cast themselves
on the beach of blue skyland in great breakers
of snow-crested mountains.</p>

<p>At the side of the house was a dooryard&mdash;so
small!&mdash;beaten hard and smooth as a floor, and without
a tree or a bush. There was no grass even at
the edge of the sturdy little stream that ran across
the square enclosure, talking all day to the old-faced
baby in its high chair under the shake-covered
kitchen porch. All day the stream laughed and chattered
noisily to the owl-eyed baby, and chuckled and
gurgled as it hurried across the yard and burrowed
under the weather-bleached boards of the high fence,
to find its way along the edge of the street, and so
on to the river a quarter of a mile below. But the
wee woman-child, owl-eyed and never complaining,
sat through the long sunshine hours without one
smile on its little old face, and never heeding the
stream.</p>

<p>As the days grew hotter, its little thin hands became
thinner, and it ate less and less of the boiled arroz<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
and papas the young mother sometimes brought when
she came to dip water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of a truth, there is no ni&ntilde;a so good as my &#8217;Stacia;
she never, never cries! She is no trouble to me at
all,&#8221; Carmelita would exclaim, and clap her hands
at the baby. But the baby only grew rounder eyed
as it stared unsmilingly at its mother&#8217;s pretty plumpness,
and laughing red lips, and big black eyes, whenever
she stopped to talk to the little one.</p>

<p>Carmelita&mdash;pretty, shallow-pated Carmelita&mdash;never
stayed long with the tiny &#8217;Stacia, for the baby was so
good left alone; and there was always Anton or
Luciano and Monico to drop in for a laugh with the
young wife of stupid old Lucas; or Josefa coming in
for a game of &#8220;coyote y gallos.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Lucas who went out to the porch whenever
he could spare the time from earning money that
he might buy the needed arroz and papas, or the
rose-colored dresses he liked to see her wear.</p>

<p>It was for Lucas she said her first word&mdash;the only
word she had learned yet&mdash;&#8220;papa!&#8221; And she said it,
he thought, as if she knew it was a love in no wise
different from a father&#8217;s love that he gave her, poor
little Anastacia, whose father&mdash;well, Lucas had never
asked Carmelita to tell him. How could he? Poor
child, let her keep her secret. Pobre Carmelita! Only
sixteen and no mother. And could he&mdash;Lucas&mdash;see
her beaten and abused by that old woman who took
the labor of her hands and gave her nothing in
return?&mdash;could he stand by when he saw the big
welts and bruises, and not beg her to let him care for
her and the ni&ntilde;a?&mdash;such a little ni&ntilde;a it was, too! Of
a verity, he was no longer young; and there was his
ugly pock-marked face, to say nothing of the scars
the oso had given him that day when he, a youth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
had sent his knife to the hilt in the bear that so
nearly cost him his life. The scars were horrible to
see&mdash;horrible! But Carmelita (so young&mdash;so pretty!)
did not seem to mind; and when the priest came again
they were married, so that Carmelita had a husband
and the pobrecita a father.</p>

<p>And such a father! How Lucas loved his little
&#8217;Stacia! How tender he was with her; how his heart
warmed to the touch of her lips and hands! Why,
he grew almost jealous of the red-breasted robin that
came daily to sit by the edge of her plate and eat
arroz with her! He begrudged the bird its touch of
the little sticky hand covered with grains of rice
which the robin pecked at so fearlessly. And when
the sharp bill hurt the tender flesh, how she would
scold! She was not his &#8217;Stacia then at all&mdash;no, some
other baby very different from the solemn little one
he knew. There seemed something unearthly in it,
and Lucas would feel a sinking of his heart and wish
the bird would stay away. It never came when
others were there. Only from the shelter of window
or doorway did he and the others see the little bright
bird-eyes watch&mdash;with head aslant&mdash;the big black
ones; or hear the baby bird-talk between the two.
Every day throughout the long, hot summer the robin
came to eat from the ni&ntilde;a&#8217;s plate of rice as she sat
in her high chair under the curling shake awning; and
all the while she grew more owl-eyed and thin. A
good ni&ntilde;a, she was, and so little trouble!</p>

<p>One day the robin did not come. That night,
through the open windows of the front room,
passers-by could see a table covered with a folded
sheet. A very small table&mdash;it did not need to be
large; but the bed had been taken out of the small,
mean room to give space to those who came to look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
at the poor, little, pinched face under a square of
pink mosquito bar. There were lighted candles at
the head and feet. Moths, flying in and out of the
wide open window, fluttered about the flames. The
rose-colored dress had been exchanged for one that
was white and stiffly starched. Above the wee gray
face was a wreath of artificial orange blossoms, but
the wasted baby-fingers had been closed upon some
natural sprays of lovely white hyacinths. The cloying
sweetness of the blossoms mingled with the odor
of cigarette smoke coming from the farther corners
of the room, and the smell of a flaring kerosene lamp
which stood near the window. It flickered uncertainly
in the breeze, and alternately lighted or threw
into shadow the dark faces clustered about the doorway
of the second room. Those who in curiosity lingered
for a moment outside the little adobe house could
hear voices speaking in the soft language of Spain.</p>

<p>To them who peered within with idle interest, it
was &#8220;only some Mexican woman&#8217;s baby dead.&#8221; Tomorrow,
in a little white-painted coffin, it would be
born down the long street, past the saloons and shops
where the idle and the curious would stare at the
procession. Over the bridge across the now muddy
river they would go to the unfenced graveyard on
the bluff, and there the little dead mite of illegitimacy
would be lowered into the dust from whence it came.
Then each mourner in turn would cast a handful of
earth into the open grave, and the clods would rattle
dully on the coffin lid. (Ah, pobre, pobre Lucas!)
Then they would come away, leaving Carmelita&#8217;s
baby there underground.</p>

<p>Carmelita herself was now sitting apathetically by
the coffin. She dully realized what tomorrow was to
be; but she could not understand what this meant.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
She had cried a little at first, but now her eyes were
dry. Still, she was sorry&mdash;it had been such a good
little baby, and no trouble at all!</p>

<p>&#8220;A good ni&ntilde;a, and never sick; such a good little
&#8217;Stacia!&#8221; she murmured. Carmelita felt very sorry
for herself.</p>

<p>Outside, in the darkness of the summer night, Lucas
sat on the kitchen porch leaning his head against the
empty high chair of the pobrecita, and sobbed as if
his heart would break.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That had happened in August. Through September,
pretty Carmelita cried whenever she remembered what
a good baby the little Anastacia had been. Then
Josefa began coming to the house again to play
&#8220;coyote y gallos&#8221; with her, so that she forgot to
cry so often.</p>

<p>As for Lucas, he worked harder than ever. Though,
to be sure, there were only two now to work for
where there had been three. With Anton, and
Luciano, and Monico, he had been running in wild
horses from the mountains; and among others which
had fallen to his share was an old blaze-face roan
stallion, unmanageable and full of vicious temper.
They had been put&mdash;these wild ones&mdash;in a little pasture
on the other side of the river; a pasture in the
rancho of Se&ntilde;or Metcalf, the Americano. And the
se&ntilde;or, who laughed much and liked fun, had said he
wanted to see the sport when Lucas should come to
ride the old roan.</p>

<p>Today, Lucas&mdash;on his sleek little cow-horse, Topo&mdash;was
riding along the river road leading to the
rancho; but not today would he rope the old blaze-face.
There were others to be broken. Halfway
from the bridge he met little Nicol&aacute;s, who worked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
for the se&ntilde;or, and passed him with a pleasant
&#8220;Buenos dias!&#8221; without stopping. The boy had been
his good amigo since the time he got him away from
the maddened steer that would have gored him to
death. There was nothing &#8217;Col&aacute;s would not do for
his loved Lucas. But the older man cared not to
stop and talk to him today, as was his custom; for
he was gravely thinking of the little dead &#8217;Stacia,
and rode on. A hundred yards farther, and he heard
the clatter of a horse&#8217;s hoofs behind him, and Nicol&aacute;s
calling:</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucas! Lucas!&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned the rein on Topo&#8217;s neck, and waited till
the boy came. In the pleasant, warm October sunlight
he waited, while Nicol&aacute;s told him that which would
always make him shiver and feel cold when afterward
he should remember that half-hour in the stillness and
sunshine of the river road. He waited, even after
Nicol&aacute;s (frightened at having dared to tell his friend)
had gone.</p>

<p>The se&ntilde;or and Carmelita! It was the truth&mdash;Nicol&aacute;s
would not lie. The truth; for the boy had
listened behind the high fence of weather-beaten
boards, and had heard them talk together. He, and
the little stream that gurgled and laughed all day,
had heard how they&mdash;the se&ntilde;or and Carmelita&mdash;would
go away to the north when the month should end.
For many months they two had loved&mdash;the Se&ntilde;or Metcalf
and the wife of Lucas; had loved before Lucas
had made her his wife&mdash;ay! even before the little
&#8217;Stacia had come. And the little &#8217;Stacia was the
se&ntilde;or&#8217;s&mdash;&mdash; Ah, Lucas would not say it of the dead
pobrecita! For she was his&mdash;Lucas&#8217;s&mdash;by right of
his love for her. Poor little Anastacia! And but that
the little one would have been a trouble to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
Americano, they&mdash;the woman and the man&mdash;would
have gone away together before; but he would not
have it so. Now that the little one was no longer to
trouble them, he would take the mother and go away
to the new rancho he had just bought far over on the
other side of the mountains.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p065.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;Their eyes met.&#8221;&mdash;Page <a href="#Page_65">65</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Go!&#8221;&mdash;said Lucas, when the boy had finished telling
all he had overheard&mdash;&#8220;Go and tell the se&ntilde;or that
I go now to the corral to ride the roan stallion. And&mdash;&#8217;Col&aacute;s,
give to me thy riata for today.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Lucas had driven the horses into one of the corrals.
Alone there he had lassoed the old blaze-face; and
then had driven the others out. Unaided, he had
tied the old stallion down. As he lay there viciously
biting and trying to strike out with his hind feet,
Lucas had fastened a halter on his head and had
drawn a riata (sixty feet long, and strong as the thews
of a lion) tight about him just back of the forelegs.
Twice he had passed it about the heaving girth of the
old roan, whose reeking body was muddy with sweat
and the grime and dust of the corral. The knots were
tied securely and well. The rope would not break.
Had he not made it himself from the hide of an old
toro? From jaw-piece to jaw-piece of the halter
he drew his crimson silk handkerchief, bandaging the
eyes that gleamed red under swollen and skinned lids.
Then, cautiously, Lucas unbound the four hoofs that
had been tied together. The horse did not attempt
to move, though he was consumed by a rage against
his captor that was fiendish&mdash;the fury of a wild beast
that has never yet been conquered.</p>

<p>Lucas struck him across the ribs with the end of
the rope he was holding. The big roan head was
lifted from the ground a second and then let fall, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
he squealed savagely. Again the rope made a hollow
sound against the heaving sides. Again the maddened
horse squealed. When the rope struck the third time,
he gathered himself together uncertainly&mdash;hesitated&mdash;struggled
an instant&mdash;staggered to his feet, and
stood quivering in every muscle of his great body.
His legs shook under him; and his head&mdash;with the
bandaged eyes&mdash;moved from side to side unsteadily.</p>

<p>Then Lucas wound the halter-rope&mdash;which was
heavy and a long one&mdash;around the center-post of the
corral where they were standing.</p>

<p>As he finished, he heard someone singing; the voice
coming nearer and nearer. A man&#8217;s voice it was,
full and rich, caroling a love song, the sound mingling
with that of clattering hoofs.</p>

<p>Lucas, stooping, picked up the riata belonging to
Nicol&aacute;s. He was carefully re-coiling it when Guy
Metcalf, riding up to the enclosure, looked down into
the corral.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Lucas! &#8216;Going to have some fun with the
old roan,&#8217; are you? Well, you&#8217;re the boy to ride
him. &#8216;Haven&#8217;t got the saddle on yet, hey?&#8217; Hold
on a minute&mdash;&mdash; Soon as I tie, I&#8217;ll be with you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucas had not spoken, neither had he raised his
head. He went to where little Topo was standing.
Shaking the noose into place by a turn or two of the
wrist, while the long loop dragged at his heels through
the dust, he put his foot in the stirrup and swung
himself into the saddle. He glanced at the gate&mdash;he
ran the noose out yet a little more. Then he
began to swing it slowly in easy, long sweeps above
his head while he waited.</p>

<p>The gate opened and Metcalf came in. He turned
and carefully fastened the gate behind him. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
a third of the way across the corral when their
eyes met.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;with its serpent hiss of warning&mdash;the circling
riata, snake-like, shot out, fastening its coils about
him. And Topo, the little cow-horse trained to such
work, wheeled at the touch of the spur as the turns
of the rope fastened themselves about the horn of
the saddle, and the man&mdash;furrowing the hoof-powdered
dust of the corral&mdash;was dragged to the heels of the
wild stallion. Lucas, glancing hastily at the face,
earth-scraped and smeared and the full lips that were
bleeding under their fringe of gold, saw that&mdash;though
insensible for a moment from the quick jerk
given the rope&mdash;the blue eyes of the man were opening.
Lucas swung himself out of the saddle&mdash;leaving
Topo to hold taut the riata. Then he began the
work of binding the doomed Americano. When he
had done, to the doubled rope of braided rawhide
that was about the roan stallion, he made Carmelita&#8217;s
lover fast with the riata he had taken from Nicol&aacute;s.
He removed it slowly from the man&#8217;s neck (the
se&ntilde;or should not have his eyes closed too quickly to
the valley through which he would pass!) and he
put it about the body, under the arms. Lucas was
lingering now over his work like one engaged in
some pleasant occupation.</p>

<p>The halter-rope was then unknotted, and the turns
unwound from the center-post. Next, he pulled the
crimson handkerchief from the horse&#8217;s eyes&mdash;shouted&mdash;and
shook his hat at him!</p>

<p>Maddened, terrified, and with the dragging thing
at his heels, the four-footed fury fought man, and
earth, and air about him like the very demon that he
was till he came to the gate that Lucas had set wide
for him, and he saw again the waves of sage and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
sand hills (little waves of sweet-scented sage) that
rippled away to the mountains he knew. Out there
was liberty; out there was the free life of old; and
there he could get rid of the thing at his heels that&mdash;with
all his kicking, and rearing, and plunging&mdash;still
dragged at the end of the rope.</p>

<p>Out through the wide set gate he passed, mad with
an awful rage, and as with the wings of the wind.
On, and on he swept; marking a trail through the
sand with his burden. Faster and faster, and growing
dim to the sight of the man who stood grim and
motionless at the gate of the corral. Away! away to
those far-lying mountains that are breakers on the
beach of blue skyland!</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;TO be hung. To be hung by the neck
until dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Over and over I say it to myself as I
sit here in my room in the hotel, trying
to think connectedly of the events which
have led to the culmination of this awful
thing that, in so short a time, is to deprive me of life.</p>

<p>At eleven o&#8217;clock I am to die; to go out of the
world of sunshine and azure seas, of hills and vales
of living green, of the sweet breath of wild flowers
and fruit bloom, of light and laughter and the music
of Life, to&mdash;&mdash;what? Where? How far does the
Soul go? What follows that awful moment of final
dissolution?</p>

<p>At eleven o&#8217;clock I shall know; for I must die.
There is no hope, no help; though my hand has never
been raised against mortal man or woman&mdash;never
have I taken a human life.</p>

<p>At the stroke of the hour a great crowd will stand
in the prison yard, and gape at the scaffold, and see
the drop fall, and&mdash;fascinated and frowning&mdash;gaze
with straining eyes at the Thing dangling at the end
of a hempen rope. A Soul will go out into immeasurable
space. A purple mark on my throat will tell
the story of death by strangulation. Two bodies will
lie stark and dead tonight&mdash;his and mine. His will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
be laid in the pine box that belongs to the dishonored
dead; while mine will be housed in rosewood, and
satin, and silver.</p>

<p>You do not understand?</p>

<p>Listen, let me tell you! Let me go back to the
first time we ever met&mdash;he and I.</p>

<p>After college days were over, I left the Atlantic
coast and all that Life there meant to me, and came
out to the West of the sagebrush, and the whirlwinds,
and the little horned toads. And there in the wide
wastes where there is nothing but the immensity of
space and the everlasting quiet of the desert, I went
into business for myself. Business there? Oh, yes!
for out there where men go mad or die, cattle and
sheep may thrive. I, who loved Life and the association
of bright minds, and everything that such
companionship gives, invested all I had (and little
enough it was!) in a business of which I knew nothing,
except that those men who went there with a
determination to stick to the work till success should
find them, brought away bags full of gold&mdash;all they
could carry&mdash;as they came back into the world they
had known before their self-banishment.</p>

<p>So I, too, went there, and bought hundreds of
sheep&mdash;bleating&mdash;blear-eyed, stupid creatures that
they are! I, essentially a man of cities and of people,
began a strange, new life there, becoming care-taker
of the flocks myself.</p>

<p>A lonely life? Yes; but remember there was money
to be made in sheep-raising in the gray wastes; and
I was willing to forego, for a time, all that civilization
could give. So I dulled my recollections of the old
life and the things that were dear to me, and went
to work with a will in caring for the dusty, bleating,
aimlessly-moving sheep. I wanted to be rich. Not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
for the sake of riches, but to be independent of the
toil of bread-winning. I longed with all my soul to
have money, that I might gratify my old desires for
travel away to the far ends of the earth. All my
life I had dreamed of the day I was to turn my face
to those old lands far away, which would be new lands
to me. So I was glad to sacrifice myself for a few
years in the monstrous stillness of the gray plains
so that I might the sooner be free to go where I would.</p>

<p>Friends tried to dissuade me from the isolated life.
They declared I was of a temperament that could
not stand the strain of the awful quiet there&mdash;the
eternal silence broken only by some lone coyote&#8217;s
yelp, or the always &#8220;Baa! Baa!&#8221; of the sheep. They
told me that men before my time had gone stark mad&mdash;that
I, too, would lose my mind. I laughed at them,
and went my way; yet, in truth, there was many a
day through the long years I lived there, when I
felt myself near to madness as I watched the slow-moving,
dust-powdered woolly backs go drifting
across the landscape as a gray fog drifts in from the
sea. It seemed the desert was the emptier by reason
of the sheep being there, for nothing else moved.
Never a sign of life but the sheep; never a sound but
the everlasting &#8220;Baa! Baa! Baa!&#8221; Oh! I tell you I was
very near to madness then, and many another man
in my place would have broken under the tension.
But not I. I was strong because I was growing rich.
I made money. I took it eastward to the sea, and
watched the ships go out. It was a fine thing to see
the great waste of waters move, as the desert waste
never had. There was the sea, and beyond lay far
lands! Still, I said to myself:</p>

<p>&#8220;No; not yet will I go. I will wait yet a little
longer. I will wait until I hold so much gold in my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
hands that I need never return&mdash;need never again
look upon the desert and its ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>So&mdash;though I watched the ships sail away to waiting
lands beyond&mdash;the time was not yet ripe for me
to go. Back to the money-making a little longer&mdash;back
for a while to the stupid, staring-eyed sheep&mdash;then
a final good-bye to the desert&#8217;s awful emptiness,
and that never-ceasing sound that is worse than silence&mdash;the
bleating of the flocks!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was on one of these trips to the Atlantic coast
that I saw, for the first time, him of the Half-a-Soul.</p>

<p>The hour was late afternoon of a hot mid-summer
day. The sun was red as blood and seemed quadrupled
in size where it hung on the horizon with its silent
warning of another terrible day on the morrow.
Block-pavements and cobbles radiated heat, and the
sidewalks burned my feet painfully as I stepped on
their scorching surfaces coming out of my friend
Burnham&#8217;s office. The hot air stifled me, and I flinched
at the dazzling light. Then I stepped in with the
throng, and in a moment more was part of the great
surging mass of heat-burdened humanity. Drifting
with the pulsating stream, I was for the time listlessly
indifferent to what might be coming except that I
longed for the night, and for darkness. It might not,
probably would not, bring any welcome cool breeze,
but at least in the shadows of the night there would
be a respite from the torturing white glare that was
now reflected from every sun-absorbing brick, or
square of granite or stone. I was drifting along the
great current of Broadway life when&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was a sudden clutching at my heart&mdash;a tension
on the muscles that was an acute pain&mdash;a reeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
of the brain&mdash;and I found myself gazing eagerly into
two eyes that as eagerly gazed back into mine. Dark
eyes they were, smoldering with evil passions and the
light of all things that are bad. The eyes of a man
I had never known&mdash;had never seen; yet between
whom and myself I felt existed a kinship stronger
than any tie that my life had hitherto admitted. For
one instant I saw those strange black eyes, blazing
and baleful, the densely black hair worn rather long,
the silky mustache brushed up from the corners of
the mouth, the gleam of the sharp white teeth under
a lifted lip, the smooth heavy eyebrows slightly curving
upward at the outer edges, giving the face the
expression we give to the pictures we make of Satan.
These I saw. Then he was lost in the crowd.</p>

<p>Where had I seen him before that these details
should all seem so familiar? I knew (and my blood
chilled as I confessed it to myself) that in all my life
I had never seen or known him in the way I had seen
and known others. And, more, I knew that we were
linked by some strange, unknown, unnamed, unnatural
tie. It was as though a hand gloved in steel had
clutched my heart in a strangling grip as he moved
past. I gasped for breath, staggered, caught myself,
and&mdash;staggering again&mdash;fell forward on the pavement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sunstroke,&#8221; they said. &#8220;Overcome by the heat.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Long afterward I saw him again.</p>

<p>I was traveling in far lands. Going over from
Stamboul to Pera I stood on the Galata bridge watching
the great flood of living, pulsing human life&mdash;those
people of many races.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>There was a fresh breeze from the North that day,
and it set dancing the caiques and barcas where they
threaded their way among the big ferry-boats and
ships of many strange sails, and all the craft of summer
seas. There was a sparkle on the Bosphorus
under the golden sunshine and a gleam on the Golden
Horn. A violet-hued haze hung over the wide expanse,
and through it one could see the repeated graces of
mosque and minaret, the Seven Towers and the
rounded whiteness of Santa Sophia. Higher, there
was the green of laurel and lime, of rose-tree and
shrubbery in profusion&mdash;terrace upon terrace&mdash;and
now and again darker shadows made by the foliage
of cypress or pine. All the morning I had reveled in
Nature&#8217;s great color scheme; had feasted eye and
sense on the amethyst, and emerald, and sapphire of
water, and sky and shore. And then I went to the
Galata bridge.</p>

<p>There I stood and watched that medley of races
moving by. Arab and Ethiopian, Moslem and Jew;
the garb of modern European civilization, and the
flowing robes of the East; Kurds, Cossacks and Armenians;
the gaudy red fez and the white turban of the
Turk; dogs lean and sneaking-eyed; other eyes that
looked out from under the folds of a yashmak. And
always the babel of voices speaking many tongues.
Greeks and Albanians; the flowing mantle of Bedouins
and the Tartar in sheepskins. Ebbing and flowing&mdash;ebbing
and flowing, the restless human tide at the
great Gateway of the East.</p>

<p>As I stood looking and listening, there came again
without warning that clutching at my heartstrings&mdash;that
sharp pain in my left side&mdash;that same dizzying
whirl of thoughts&mdash;that sickening fear of something
(I knew not what) which I could not control; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
out of the flowing tide of faces I saw one not a
stranger&mdash;he whom I did not know. His eyes held
mine again; and in that moment something seemed
to tell me that he was my everlasting curse. Through
him would come things dread and evil; from him
there was no escape. I looked long&mdash;my eyes starting
in their sockets. I gasped&mdash;caught at the air&mdash;and
lost consciousness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When I recovered myself I was sitting in a little
caf&eacute; whither a young lad had assisted me. I gave him
a few piasters and told him to leave me. He took
them, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pek eyi!&#8221; and went away.</p>

<p>Left alone at the caf&eacute; table, after motioning the
attendant also away, I sat and pondered. Where
would this haunting dread end? The basilisk eyes
I so loathed had borne me a message which I could
not yet translate. Not yet. But he would pass me
again some day, and once more his eyes would speak
a message. What was it? Something evil, I knew.
But what?</p>

<p>So I went away; went away from the Galata
bridge; away from Pera and Stamboul.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Then from the deck of a dahabeeyeh on the Nile!</p>

<p>I was with the Burnhams. We were eight in the
party. Lucille Burnham (Joe&#8217;s sister) and I were
betrothed. Betrothed after months and months of
playing at love, and the making and unmaking of
lovers&#8217; quarrels. Each had thought the other meant
nothing more than what makes for an idler&#8217;s pastime,
until drifting on the current of old Nilus we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
read the true love in each other&#8217;s heart, and the story
(old as Egypt is old) was told over again there
where it was told centuries before by men and women
who loved in the land of the lotus.</p>

<p>Joe and his wife, and the Merrills (brother and sister),
Colonel Lamar and his pretty daughter, and my
dear girl and I. What a happy, care-free party we
were! My most precious dreams were coming true;
and now I went up and down the earth&#8217;s highways
as I willed.</p>

<p>Under the awning that day I was lying at Lucille&#8217;s
feet, half-asleep, half-awake and wholly happy. I
remember how, just there above Luxor, I noticed two
women on the river bank, the dull-blue dress of the
one, and the other carrying a water-skin to be filled.
A boy, naked and brown-skinned, sprawled in the
sand. Moving&mdash;slow moving with the current&mdash;we
came drifting out of that vast land that is old as
Time itself reckons age.</p>

<p>Then between my vision and the banks beginning
the level which reached far and away to the hills
beyond, came the shadow of a lateen sail not our own.
A dahabeeyeh was slipping by, going against the current.
I raised myself on my elbow, and there&mdash;unfathomable,
dark as Erebus, and gazing out of deep
sockets&mdash;were the eyes of a man who drew me to
him with a power I was unable to resist; a power
fearful as&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The thin, sneering lips seemed to whisper the word
&#8220;Brother!&#8221; and &#8220;Brother&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; I whispered back.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The sight of that face under the shadow of the
lateen sail&mdash;like a shadow cast by a carrion bird
where it slowly moves above you in the desert&mdash;coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
as it did, in the midst of my days of love and
new-found joy, left me unnerved and wrecked both
mentally and physically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, come! this won&#8217;t do,&#8221; said Joe; &#8220;I am afraid
you are going to have the fever!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is nothing,&#8221; I declared, shrinking from his
scrutiny, &#8220;I&mdash;&mdash;I have these attacks sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is he? What is he?&#8221; I asked myself the
question hourly. And there in the silence of those
nights under the stars of the East, while we breathed
the soft winds blowing across the sands the Pharaohs
had trod, the answer came to me:</p>

<p>He was my other Half-Self&mdash;the twin half of my
own Soul. This brother of mine&mdash;this being for
whom I had a loathing deep and intense&mdash;was one in
whom there lived an incomplete Soul (a half that was
evil through and through) and mine was the other
half. I was beginning now to understand. We had
been sent into this world with but one Soul between
us; and to me had been apportioned the good. But
evil or good&mdash;good and evil&mdash;we were henceforth to
be inseparable in our fate.</p>

<p>But always I cried out in my helpless, hopeless
agony, &#8220;Yet why&mdash;why&mdash;why?&#8221; It is the cry of the
Soul from the first day of creation.</p>

<p>I turned my back on the far East, and set my face
towards America.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Then I started on a trip through California and old
Mexico. My health was broken. My marriage with
Lucille was postponed.</p>

<p>On the Nevada desert our train was side-tracked
early one morning to allow the passing of the eastbound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
express which was late. A vast level plain
stretched its weary way in every direction. Only the
twin lines of steel and the dark-red section house
showed that the White Man&#8217;s footsteps had ever
found their way into the stillness of the dreary plains.</p>

<p>We had fifteen minutes to wait. I got out with
others and walked up and down the wind-blown track,
smoking my cigar and spinning pebbles, which I picked
up from the road-bed, at a jack-rabbit in the sagebrush
across the way. The wind made a mournful
sound through the telegraph wires, but a wild canary
sang sweetly from the top of a tall greasewood&mdash;sang
as if to drown the wind&#8217;s dirge. Dull grays were
about us; and we were hemmed in by mountains
rugged, and rough, and dull gray, with here and
there touches of dull reds and browns. On their very
tops patches of snow lay, far&mdash;far up on the heights.
Miles down the valley we could see the coming train.
A few minutes later the conductor called to us &#8220;All
aboard!&#8221; and I swung myself up on the steps of the
last sleeping-car as we began to move slowly down
toward the western end of the switch.</p>

<p>There was a roar and a clatter&mdash;a flash of faces at
the windows&mdash;a rush of wind and dust whirled up
by the whirling wheels&mdash;and, as the Eastern Express
shot by, I saw (on the rear platform of the last car)
him, between whom and myself a Soul was shared.</p>

<p>The conductor stepped up on the platform where I
stood, and caught me by the arm as I reeled.</p>

<p>&#8220;The high altitude,&#8221; he said, &#8220;makes a good many
folks get dizzy. You&#8217;d better go inside and sit
down.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then again.</p>

<p>On a ferry-boat crossing the bay from the Oakland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
pier to San Francisco. I had just returned that
morning from a four-months&#8217; tour of Mexico. It was
raining dismally, and everything about the shipping
on the bay was dripping and dreary. Gray-white sea
gulls circled and screamed; darting and dipping, they
followed our wake, or dropped down into the foam
churned up by the wheels. Winds&mdash;wet and salty,
and fresh from the sea&mdash;tugged at our mackintoshes;
and flapped the gowns and wraps of the women where&mdash;huddled
together away from the rail&mdash;we stood
under shelter. Sheets of flying fog&mdash;dense, dark and
forbidding&mdash;went by; gray ghosts of the ocean&#8217;s
uneasy dead. And back of the curtain of falling
waters and fog, whistles shrieked shrilly, and the fog
horns uttered their hideous sounds. Bellowing&mdash;moaning;
moaning&mdash;bellowing; suddenly still.</p>

<p>The city seemed but an endless succession of terraced,
water-washed houses under an endless rain.
The storm lashed the waves in the harbor into running
ridges of foam, and on the billows the ferry-boat
(falling and rising, rising and falling) pushed her
way through gray skeleton-ships at anchor, and into
her slip at the wharf. The drivers of wagons and
trucks on the lower deck, wrapped in oilskins yellow
or black and all dripping with wet, drove down the
echoing planks. Then the people began to descend
the stairways. With my right hand steadying me, I
had taken three downward steps when the gripping at
my heart told me who was passing at my left (always
at the left, it had been; at the left, always) and he of
the smoldering eyes that burned into mine like live
embers passed me quickly, and went on down the
stairway and into the rain-wetted crowd.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And again&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>It happened when, with a guide and some Club<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
friends, we went through the Chinatown slums of
the city.</p>

<p>It was Saturday night; the night of all others for
hovels and evil haunts to disgorge their hives of human
bees to swarm through passage and alley, or up and
down the dark and wretched stairways.</p>

<p>We had begun at the Joss Houses&mdash;gaudy with tinsel,
and close and choking from the incense of burning
tapers. We had gone to restaurant and theater.
At the one, going in through the back way and on
through their cooking rooms where they were preparing
strange and repulsive looking food; at the
other, using the stage entrance and going on the
stage with the players. Into opium joints our guide
led the way, where the smokers in their utter degradation
lay like the dead, as the drug carried the dreamers
into a land of untranslatable dreams. We had looked
at the pelf in the pawn-shops, and at the painted
faces of Chinese courtesans looking out through their
lattices.</p>

<p>Then underground we had gone down (three
stories) and had seen places and beings hideous in
their loathesomeness; loathesome beyond description.
To the &#8220;Dog Kennel.&#8221; Up to earth&#8217;s surface again;
to &#8220;The Rag Picker&#8217;s Paradise.&#8221; Through &#8220;Cum
Cook Alley&#8221;&mdash;through &#8220;Ross Alley,&#8221; where within a
few feet, within a few years, murder after murder
had been committed, and (the murderers escaping
through the network of secret passageways and hidden
doors) the deaths had gone unavenged. Through
the haunts of highbinders, and thugs and assassins
we moved; and once I passed a little child&mdash;a half-caste&mdash;toddling
through the alley that was reeking
with filth. &#8220;Look out, Baby!&#8221; I said, as he stumbled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
and fell. &#8220;Look out, Man!&#8221; he answered in English,
and laughed.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p079.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;Again the sirocco passed.&#8221;&mdash;Page <a href="#Page_79">79</a></p>

<p>Then, somewhere between high walls that reached
to the open air, I found myself alone&mdash;left behind
by the others. I could see the guide&#8217;s light burning&mdash;a
tiny red spark&mdash;far ahead in the darkness, but
my own candle had gone out. Away up in the narrow
slit showing the sky, shone the cold, still stars.
Under my feet crunched clinkers and cinders wet
with a little stream from some sewer running over
the ground.</p>

<p>Then in the dark wall a door opened, and as the
light from within lit up the inky blackness without
I saw him again. Again the sirocco passed, burning&mdash;scorching
the life-blood in my veins.</p>

<p>They came back and found me lying in the wet of
the noisome alley. For weeks, in the hotel, I lay ill;
then, as soon as I was able to walk unassisted, I took
passage for Japan, intending to extend my trip to
Suez, and through Europe, on home. I said to myself
that I would never again set foot in San Francisco.
I feared that horrible something, the power
of which seemed stronger over me there than elsewhere.
Six times we had met and passed. I shrank
from the seventh. Each time that we had come face
to face&mdash;met&mdash;passed&mdash;drifted apart, I heard a voice
saying that my life was being daily drawn closer and
closer into his, to be a part of the warp and woof of
his own. And the end? It would be&mdash;&mdash;when?
Where? In what way? What would be that final
meeting of ours? How far off was it? What would
that fatal seventh meeting mean for us both?</p>

<p>I fled from the city as one does from the touch of
a leper. I dared not stay.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>But the third day out on the ocean there suddenly
came over me a knowledge that a greater force than
my own will would compel me to return. Something
bade me go back. I fought with it; I battled
with the dread influence the rest of the voyage. It
was useless. I was a passenger on the ship when it
returned to San Francisco. There I found the whole
city talking and horrified, over a murder hideous,
foul, revolting. Carmen de la Guerra, a young
Spanish woman, had been brutally murdered&mdash;butchered
by her lover. I was sick&mdash;chilled, when I
heard. A foreboding of the truth came to me as I
listened. I feverishly read the papers; they told of
the tragedy in all its frightful details. I went to the
public libraries for the back files. Then I went to
the jail to look at the face of the fiend who had killed
her. I knew whom I should see behind the bars. It
was he. And it was the seventh meeting.</p>

<p>His eyes bade me go and get him release.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go!&#8221; they said, &#8220;Call to your aid all the angels
of your heaven, and the help of the demons who are
one with me in hell, that you may save me from the
gallows. My Soul is your Soul; if I die, you also
must die with me. Keep the rope from me; for you
are fighting for your own life. Go!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I went out of the chill jail corridors a madman. I
raved against the hellish destiny. What use? I must
save him, or I must die with him. No one understood.
I told no one my secret. Early and late; day and
night I worked unceasingly to get him pardoned.
God! how I worked to save him. I tried every conceivable
means to secure him his life. I exhausted
all methods known to the law. I spent money as a
mill-wheel runs water.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>&#8220;You believe him innocent?&mdash;this fiend!&#8221; my
friends cried aghast&mdash;amazed at my mad eagerness
to get him acquittal.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! not that!&#8221; I answered in my agony, &#8220;but he
must not die&mdash;shall not hang! Shall not! Do you
hear? Innocent or guilty&mdash;what do I care? Only he
must live, that I shall not die.&#8221;</p>

<p>But no one understood.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It has been in vain. At eleven o&#8217;clock he is to
be hung. The death-watch is with him. And the
death-watch is here, too, with me. Two are here; and
the name of one is Horror, and the other&#8217;s name is
Fear. Down below I hear the rattle of traffic on the
streets, and in the hotel corridors I hear the voices
of people talking&mdash;just now I heard one laugh. They
do not know. And Lucille&mdash;&mdash; Ah, my poor
Lucille!</p>

<p>The tide of life is running out, and the end is
drawing nigh. I have come to find at last that evil
is always stronger than good; and in that way he
draws me after him. I cannot hold the half of his
Soul back. Closer and closer together we come. A
Divided Soul&mdash;his and mine. His body has housed
the evil half&mdash;mine the good. His is all that is vile,
and bestial, and bloodthirsty; mine has always striven
after the best. Yet because of his sin I, too, must die.</p>

<p>At the hour of eleven he will hang for the murder
of Carmen de la Guerra. At eleven I, too, must die.
As the sheriff cuts the rope, and the evil Divided Soul
swings out eternity-ward from the body which has
housed it evilly, so will I die at that instant&mdash;death by
strangulation. For a Divided Soul may not live when
its twin is gone. Death. And then one body in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
rosewood casket, and one in its box of pine.</p>

<p>At eleven&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Baa! Baa!&#8221; I hear the sheep&mdash;&mdash; No; it is&mdash;&mdash;
What is it? I cannot see&mdash;&mdash; Something is being
pressed down over my eyes, shutting out the light.
My arms&mdash;my feet are being tied&mdash;I cannot move.
Help! Something is closing on my neck&mdash;I cannot
breathe. It is tightening&mdash;choking&mdash;&mdash; I hear the
bleating of the sheep&mdash;&mdash; God! God! I am strangling!
The rope&mdash;&mdash; It is the rope&mdash;and Death.</p>

<p>May God have mercy on my Soul!</p>

<p class="drop-cap">JON LANDIS turned the bit of black rock
over and over in his hand as he held it
under the searching Nevada sunlight.
The lids of his light blue eyes narrowed as
he looked, and he chewed nervously at
the corner of his long upper lip under its
cropped reddish mustache. Finally, as though wholly
satisfied with the close scrutiny he had given it, he
nodded his head slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think he good? All same like that other
kin&#8217; you show um me?&#8221;</p>

<p>The young Paiute was peering into his palm, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess so, Nick,&#8221; answered Landis; &#8220;Anyway,
you no tell um &#8217;nother man &#8217;bout this. Savvy?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Paiute nodded. It was evident that he
&#8220;savvied.&#8221; He had shown Landis a copper ledge off
in the mountains, two years before, and Landis had
given him a hundred dollars. It was Indian Nick&#8217;s
opinion that Landis was &#8220;heap pretty good man;&#8221; and
he now recognized the value of silence until such a
time as Landis would let him speak. Other white men
had, before this, got him to show them prospects upon
promises, and&mdash;without an exception&mdash;had cheated
him out of his due. But Jon Landis was different.
This big, quiet man who talked but little, and never
laughed at all&mdash;him he would be &#8220;partner&#8221; with, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
show him the place down by the river where the
black rock sample came from, and the bluffs where&mdash;underneath&mdash;a
queer little spring (that wasn&#8217;t water)
oozed forth, and lost itself a dozen feet away in the
muddy current of the greater stream.</p>

<p>Indian Nick didn&#8217;t know what that stream&mdash;a very,
very little stream&mdash;was; and he didn&#8217;t care to know.
Indians as a rule are not inquisitive. He only knew
it looked &#8220;heap greasy;&#8221; and if the black rock on
the sandy mesa above was like the piece that Landis
showed him, saying it was from California&mdash;then
Nick was to have another hundred dollars.</p>

<p>Now that Landis had &#8220;guessed&#8221; that the rock
sample was the same sort, Nick (seeing a hundred
dollars easily earned) looked furtively about him as
they stood on the railroad track&mdash;where the section
house and the freight house were sole evidence of a
station&mdash;to discover if they had been observed talking
together. For even a Paiute knows that precaution
may prevent a secret from being suspected.
No, no one had seen them together. The section foreman
was out on the road with his men, and the
telegraph operator had not come out of his office in
the freight house since he had reported the train that
had just brought Landis back to Nevada. No one
from the town (as the mining camp up in the foothills
was called) had come down to the station that
day. The Indian was satisfied; no one would guess
that he and Landis were &#8220;partners.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You come now; I show you that place. He not far&mdash;can
walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How far?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe two mile, I think. You see. You come
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>Landis deliberated. Presently he asked:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>&#8220;You got a shovel, Nick? Got a pick at your
wick-i-up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I got um ol&#8217; one&mdash;not much good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, never mind; they&#8217;ll do for today. You go
get &#8217;em, and trot on ahead. Where is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nick pointed in the direction of the river bluffs;
and when Landis had reached the mesa the Paiute&mdash;with
pick and shovel&mdash;was already there.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ol&#8217; man&mdash;my father&mdash;asked um me where I
go. I no tell um. He ask what for I take pick&mdash;take
um shovel&mdash;what I do. I no say nothin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Nick! Don&#8217;t tell anybody. By an&#8217;
by, when I get the business all fixed, then we&#8217;ll talk.
Savvy?&#8221;</p>

<p>And again Nick &#8220;savvied.&#8221;</p>

<p>All about them was the black rock from which Nick
had got the sample. Not much of it, but enough to
demonstrate the value of what it indicated. It was
undoubtedly asphaltum; the indication for oil was
good&mdash;more than good. Landis was interested. The
Paiute was moving off through the stunted greasewood
to the bluffs near the river edge, and Landis followed.</p>

<p>The face of the bluffs&mdash;eroded and uneven&mdash;rose
high above the river level; leaving but a narrow footway
between their base and the stream, here at this
point. Across by the other bank, was a growth of
rabbit-wood and sage. A twisted, leafless buck-bush
stood lonely and alone at the rim of a dry slough. The
carcass of a dead horse&mdash;victim of some horse-hide
hunter&mdash;furnished a gruesome feast for a half dozen
magpies that fluttered chattering away as the two
figures appeared on the top of the bluffs; and a coyote
that had been the magpies&#8217; companion, slipped away
into the thicket of rabbit-wood. The river was deep
here, and dirty with the debris brought down by its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
rising waters. Froth, and broken twigs, and sticks
swirled around in the eddies. To Landis, there was
something unspeakably depressing about the place,
though he was well used to the country in all its
phases. Its very stillness seemed today to weigh on
him.</p>

<p>The two men began the descent; the Indian slipping
quickly down the face of the bluffs, and Landis
clambering after.</p>

<p>There&mdash;at the foot&mdash;in a gully so narrow it would
escape any but the keenest eye, a tiny, slow-moving,
dark thread of a stream oozed from beneath the
bluffs of clay, and following the bottom of the narrow
cut that ran at right angles to the river&mdash;slipped
down into the roily waters that bore it away. Landis
squatted down by it for closer inspection. He rubbed
it between his fingers. He smelt of it. Yes, it was oil!</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Nick! You&#8217;ll get your hundred dollars!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nick grinned delightedly; but the face of Landis&mdash;from
the high cheek bones down to the square set
jaws that were burned as red as the skin of an Indian
is supposed to be&mdash;was a mask of immobility. This
find meant many thousands of dollars to him, but he
only said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, boy! Pitch in now, and dig out under that
bank!&#8221; as he pointed out a part of the bluff at the
very edge of the gully. And Nick&mdash;strong, and young,
and keen as himself to know how much of the
&#8220;greasy&#8221; stream was dammed up behind the bluffs
that the pick could disclose, swung it with strong
strokes that ate into the clay in a way that did Landis
good to see.</p>

<p>He had been working but a short time when the
pick point caught into something other than lumps of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
clay; caught at it&mdash;clawed at it&mdash;and then dragged
out (one&mdash;two&mdash;half a dozen) bones stripped of all
flesh.</p>

<p>Nick stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you stopping for?&#8221; Landis asked sharply.
&#8220;Go on! It&#8217;s only some horse or a cow that&#8217;s died
here.&#8221; But already he himself had seen the thigh
bone of a human being. Nick hesitated; still staring
at what lay there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn you, go on! What&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The steady strokes recommenced. Little by little
there was uncovered and dragged out the skeleton
of someone Who Once Was. Nick looked sullen and
strange, but he did not falter. He worked steadily
on until they lay&mdash;an indistinguishable heap&mdash;beside
the narrow gully. Landis said nothing, and the pick
strokes ate farther and farther into the bank.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a terrible sound&mdash;half a
shriek and half a gurgle that died away in the throat&mdash;which
startled them; and swinging around, Landis
saw an old Indian tottering along the narrow ledge
that bordered the river there. He was stumbling and
blindly staggering toward them, waving his arms
above his head as he came. A bareheaded, vilely
dirty and ragged old man&mdash;how old no one might be
able to say. As his bleared eyes found the skeleton
heap, he shrieked forth in the Indian tongue something
(though Landis knew no word of what he
might say) that sent a chill over him of prescient
knowledge of what was to come. He turned his back
on the old man, and addressed himself to Nick.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does he say?&#8221;</p>

<p>The younger Paiute looked old and gray with a
horror that Landis refused to translate.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>&#8220;Yes, I know. Your father. What does he say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My father&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Nick&#8217;s words came slowly,
&#8220;He say&mdash;&mdash;them&mdash;&mdash;bones&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, what? Why don&#8217;t you say what?
Can&#8217;t you talk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Them,&#8221; Nick&#8217;s teeth were chattering now, &#8220;my&mdash;&mdash;my&mdash;&mdash;mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>Landis caught his breath. Then a stinging pain
shot through his left arm, and something fell to the
ground. He swung around in time to see the old
Paiute, with another stone in his raised hand, his face
distorted with hate and fury.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quit that!&#8221; Landis yelled, and strode toward him.
But the old man&#8217;s fury was now turned to fear as
he saw this white giant bearing down on him, and the
stone fell short of its mark. He started to flee before
the strength he feared, but the narrow ledge that lay
between the river and the bluff would have been but
insecure foothold for steadier steps than his. He
tripped&mdash;reeled&mdash;and then with a cry that Landis will
remember so long as he lives&mdash;he went backward; and
down into the muddy river the eddies sucked him&mdash;down
and down&mdash;and so out of sight.</p>

<p>Then Jon Landis fought with the one who, with
raised pick, stood ready to avenge the death of his
father, and the desecration of his other dead. The
struggle was not long, but they fought as men do
who know that but one man shall live when the combat
be done. Twice the pick descending almost struck
the bared head of the white man; thrice his adversary
forced him to the very water&#8217;s edge. Landis knew he
was fighting for his life, and he watched his opportunity.
It came. Eluding that rain of death-meant
blows, he caught the Indian close to him, and with a
quick movement flung the pick far out into the river.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
Then they clinched in the final struggle for life that
to the white man or the brown man is equally dear.
Back and forth, swaying and bending, the hot breath
of each in the other&#8217;s face, they moved over the narrow
confine. It was not for long; for&mdash;with one mighty
final effort&mdash;Landis wrenched himself loose, caught at
the other, shoved&mdash;flung him off, and it was over. Jon
Landis stood there alone.</p>

<p>The fleshless skull grinned out at him from the
heap of bones. Landis shivered; he felt cold. Overhead,
clouds like swansdown were beautiful against
the sapphire blue of the afternoon sky. A soft wind
blowing down the valley brought him the sound of a
locomotive&#8217;s whistle; and the breeze was sweet with
the breath of spring flowers growing upon the banks,
away from the bluffs. A little brown bird began to
warble from the buck-brush across the river.</p>

<p>It must have been five minutes that Landis stood
there without moving. Then he picked up the shovel
and walked over to the Indian woman&#8217;s bones. It
did not take him long to dump them into the little
gully where the oil ran, and to cover them over with
loose earth from the place she had lain for thirty
years. Afterward, he scraped the earth about with
the broken shovel, to destroy all footprints. Then he
dropped it into the stream. He would never come
here again; and now there was no evidence that he
had ever been there.</p>

<p>Then he climbed the bluffs. Nor did he look back as
he walked rapidly away.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE BLUE-EYED CHIEF</h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT sounds a bit melodramatic, in these
days of &#8220;Carlisle&#8221; education for the
Indian, and with &#8220;Lo&#8221; himself on the
lecture platform, to tell of a band of one
time hostile red men having a white chief&mdash;once
a captive&mdash;who so learned to love
his captivity that when freedom was to be had for the
taking, he refused it, and still lives among them,
voluntarily. Contentedly&mdash;happily? Who knows?
He says so; and with no proof to the contrary we must
needs believe him.</p>

<p>Once in every three years he leaves his home among
the mountains of eastern Oregon, and goes for a week
to San Francisco by the sea. Once in every three
years he may be seen there on the streets, in the parks,
at the theaters, on the beach, at the Cliff or the
Heights, as strangers are seen daily, and with nothing
about him to mark him in any wise different from a
thousand others. You might pass him dozens of times
without particularly observing him, save that he is
always accompanied by a woman so evidently of a
different world than that which he has known, that
your attention is at once arrested, and your curiosity
is whetted to know the story&mdash;for story there is, you
are sure. And what a story! One does not have to
go to fiction for tales of the marvelous; and these
two&mdash;he, roughened, bearded and browned, clothed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
as the average American laborer taking a holiday;
she, with the bearing of a gentlewoman, and dressed
as they do who have found the treasure-trove that
lies at the end of the rainbow&mdash;these two have a tragic
story, all their own, that few know. It is this:</p>

<p>Back in those far days when the Pacific Railroad
was undreamed of&mdash;before we had so much as ever
guessed there might in reality be a stage line between
the Missouri and the Sacramento&mdash;one noon the
wheels of an emigrant wagon were moving down a
wide Nevada valley, where the sage gray of the short
greasewood was the only thing remotely green; moving
so slowly that they seemed not to move at all.
It was a family from one of the States of our Middle
West, going to California. The man walked beside
the slow-moving wagon. Sometimes some of the
children walked, too. The woman rode and held in
her arms a wee boy whose own arms fought and
sturdy legs struggled often to walk with the others&mdash;a
blue-eyed boy, bonny and beautiful.</p>

<p>Days and days of unblinking sunshine; and always
the awful stillness of the plains. There had been
weeks of it; and this day when they came down the
broad wash that was the drain from the bordering
mountain range, a thick heat lay on the land, making
welcome the promised noon rest where the greasewood
grew tall. All down the length of the now dry
wash the brush was more than shoulder high&mdash;annually
wetted as it was by the full spring creek.</p>

<p>When the greasewood grows so high it may easily
hide a foe.</p>

<p>The wagon bumped and ground its wheels over the
stones of the road here in the wash toward the row of
tall greasewood, a dozen yards away. Over there
they would halt for a noon rest. Over there they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
would eat their noon meal&mdash;drink from their scanty
water supply&mdash;and then resume the dreary journey.</p>

<p>This day was just such an one as all their other
desert days had been; the place seemed to them not
different in any way from the other miles of endless
monotony. As they neared the high brush, one of the
children&mdash;a fair-haired girl of eight&mdash;picking up a
bright pebble from the road, held it up that her father
might see. The other children walking beside the
wagon picked up pebbles, too&mdash;pebbles red, and purple,
and green, that had come down the bed of the creek
when the flood came. In the wagon the woman sat
holding the blue-eyed boy in her arms.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>There was a swift, singing sound in the air, and
one of the oxen staggered&mdash;bellowed&mdash;fell!</p>

<p>The sound of an arrow boring the air isn&#8217;t quite like
anything else one may ever hear; and the man knew&mdash;before
he heard the big steer&#8217;s roar of pain&mdash;that the
thing he had feared (but had at last come to believe
he had no cause to fear, when weeks passed and it
had not happened) had finally come to them.</p>

<p>Dashing out from the greasewood cover, the Indians&mdash;half
naked and wholly devilish&mdash;made quick work
of their victims. They did not dally in what they had
to do. Back on the plains another wagon&mdash;two,
three, four, a train!&mdash;was coming; they did not dare
to stay to meet such numbers. They struck only
when sure of their strength. Now they were two to
one&mdash;nay, ten men to one man! And he, that man,
went down with a wife&#8217;s shrieks and the screaming
of children&#8217;s voices in his ears.</p>

<p>It was the old story of early times and emigrants on
the plains. You have heard it time and again.</p>

<p>After the arrow, the knife; and bloody corpses left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
by a burning wagon. Things done to turn sick with
horror the next lone wayfarers who should reach this
gruesome spot. Human flesh and bone for the vultures
of the air and the wolves of the desert to feed
upon, till&mdash;taken from their preying talon and tooth&mdash;they
might be laid in the shallow graves hollowed by
the roadside.</p>

<p>Yet one was spared. The wee bonny laddie wrested
from the clinging arms of a dying mother, was held
apart to witness a butchery that strained the childish
eyes with terror. He lived, but never was he to forget
the awful scene of that hour in the desert. And when
the brutal work was over, savage arms bore him away
to their homes on the heights of near mountains gashed
by many a ca&ntilde;on.</p>

<p>There, for years upon years&mdash;growing from babyhood
to boyhood&mdash;from boyhood to youth&mdash;he lived
among them; and so became as one of their tribe.
They were a small tribe&mdash;these&mdash;of renegade Bannocks;
shifting their camps further and further into
the North, and away from the White Man&#8217;s approach
as civilization began to force them back. Northward;
and at last into Oregon.</p>

<p>The sturdy little frame remained sturdy. Some
children there are who persist in thriving under the
most adverse conditions. And he was one of these.
Yet, it must be admitted, his captors were kind; for
the Indian&mdash;savage though he may be&mdash;deals gently,
always, with his children; and this boy had become
to them as their own.</p>

<p>The baby words of the White Man&#8217;s tongue were
soon forgotten, and Indian gutterals took their place.
The little feet were moccasined with deerskin, and
the round cheeks daubed with paint. The little body
was kept warm in a rabbitskin robe. Their food was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
his food&mdash;grass seeds ground into paste, and game;
and his friends were themselves. To all intents and
purposes he had become an Indian.</p>

<p>When, at length, he reached early manhood he took
to himself an Indian bride. Then the tribe made
him their chief.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mines in the mountains had brought an army of
prospectors into the once wild country. The mines
prospered, and camps&mdash;permanent ones&mdash;multiplied.
The Red Men saw their enemy growing in numbers
beyond their strength to battle, so the depredations
became fewer and fewer, and finally ceased altogether.
&#8220;Lo&#8221; is something of a philosopher, and he generally
accepts defeat with a better grace than his white
brother. These knew they were beaten, so they were
willing to accept peace; and began to mix, by degrees,
with the Whites. They adopted the White Man&#8217;s
dress&mdash;some learned his speech. The blue-eyed chief,
too, whose position among them was never quite clear
to the miners, again learned the language that seemed
as one he had never known.</p>

<p>It was a long time before he came to realize that
his chains of captivity had dropped away&mdash;rusted
apart by time and circumstances&mdash;and that he might
now, if he so chose, go back to the people of his own
blood. He thought of it dully, indifferently, at first&mdash;then
deeply. The way was open for him! He could
go! But he came to know that down in the depths
of his heart an affection had grown up for these people
who had made him their own, that no other people
could lay claim to, ever. That for all the days of his
life his lot was here.</p>

<p>The awful events of that long gone day in the desert
were too deeply branded into his recollection ever to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
be forgotten (young child though he was at the time);
but the years had dimmed its horrors, and the associations
of a lifetime had dulled his sensibilities.</p>

<p>No! he would remain among them. As he had been,
he would still be&mdash;one of them. He had lost all desire
to go. How many years had come and gone since the
longing for liberty left him? He could not remember.
This was his home&mdash;these were his people&mdash;he would
stay.</p>

<p>And there he is today. There, a dozen years ago, a
San Franciscan, drawn by the mines, found him; and
during a summer&#8217;s companionship, gaining his confidence,
learned from his lips his story.</p>

<p>Months later, this thrice strange tale served to
entertain half a score of people who met together in
his parlors on his return. They gathered around the
story teller&mdash;close listeners&mdash;intent on every syllable;
but one there was who went white as she heard. And
when she could see him apart and unnoted, she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;He is my brother! I saw them take him away. I
was hid behind a greasewood bush&mdash;I do not know how
they overlooked me. I saw it all&mdash;everything! Then,
those in an emigrant train behind ours, came and took
me with them. I was a little child then&mdash;only eight;
and he&mdash;my brother&mdash;was younger. I thought they
had taken him away and killed him&mdash;I never guessed
he lived. I know&mdash;I am sure this is he. Tell me all
you can; for I must go and find him.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What that meeting was, no one can say. She found
him there surrounded by those who were his nearest
and dearest&mdash;a brown-skinned wife and little bronze
bairns&mdash;his! She stood face to face with him&mdash;she
clasped hands with him; yet a lifetime and all the
world lay between. Children of the loins of one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
father&mdash;born of the same mother&mdash;these two had nothing
in common between them&mdash;nothing&mdash;save the
yearning for a something that was always to lie just
beyond.</p>

<p>He yielded to her persuasions and went home
with her to see the city by the sea of which he
had heard much, but knew nothing. It was a visit of
but a few days; yet in that time no hour struck for
each alike. Try as each would for a feeling of kinship,
the other was ever a stranger.</p>

<p>She showed him the sights of the city, but he was
more and more bewildered by what he saw. At the beach
it was better; he seemed to understand the ocean best,
though seeing it for the first time. She sought to
awaken in him an interest in the things of her world.
And to his credit be it said, he honestly tried to respond
in the way she would have him.</p>

<p>But up and away to the Northeast was all he had interest
in or heart for; and so at the end of a week he
went back. Going, he pledged himself to come to her
every third year for a week&#8217;s stay; for &#8220;blood is
thicker than water,&#8221; and though they might never
strike the same chord, yet, after all, she was his sister.</p>

<p>The years wax and wane. Every third one brings
in fulfillment of the promise, the very commonplace-looking
brother who is something of a mystery to her
metropolitan friends. Time has brought brother and
sister a little more closely together, but it will never
bridge the chasm. Always there is a restraint, a reserve,
which comes from a common knowledge that
there are things in his past life he may not tell&mdash;yet,
which she guesses with an unspoken, unnamed fear.</p>

<p>Once (when the bronze-brown woman was dead), he
tried to accept civilized life as a finality. The month<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
had not rounded out to fullness when each saw the
futility of the attempt.</p>

<p>Back on the rough Oregon mountains were sons
and daughters, &#8220;flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone,&#8221;
brown-skinned though they were; and he turned his
back on the White Man and his unfamiliar ways, and
set his face toward those whom he knew best and
loved.</p>

<p>Somehow, you like and respect the man for going,
as you couldn&#8217;t had he stayed.</p>

<p>The story reads like fiction, doesn&#8217;t it? But the pity
of it is that it is true.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ACCORDING TO ONE&#8217;S STANDPOINT</h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/t.jpg" alt="" />
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE were three people in the group on
the station platform at Humboldt. The
two who were standing were a white
man and a white woman.</p>

<p>The man was tall, with breadth in his
shoulders, five-and-thirty, and rather
good looking. His dress evidenced prosperity, and
his manner betokened long residence in a city&mdash;one
of the cities east of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>The woman also was tall; and graceful, and very
pretty, and not over twenty-five years of age. She was,
without doubt, a bride, and&mdash;equally without doubt&mdash;a
fit mate for the man. She carried her chin high (a
trick common to those wearing eye-glasses) and moved
with an air of being quite sure of her social position.
She was inconspicuously dressed, but her gown, when
she walked, rustled in the way that speaks of silken
linings. She looked like a woman whose boots were
always made to order, and who, each night, had an
hour spent upon brushing her hair.</p>

<p>The third person in the group was an Indian. A
Paiute fifty years old, but who looked twenty years
older. Old George. His little withered brown face
was puckered into a whimsical smile as with head
aslant he looked up from where he sat on the bench
that was built round a tree-box. This was his frequent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
seat when the trains came in, and here he came
daily to answer the inquisitive questions of people who
deem themselves well bred.</p>

<p>He was old, and much dirtier than even the others
of his race. But he afforded entertainment for the
travelers whose pleasure it was to put questions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep, me old. &#8216;Forty?&#8217; I guess so. &#8216;One hundred?&#8217;
Maybe so; I no know.&#8221; He chuckled. It was the
same thing over and over again that they&mdash;on the
trains&mdash;asked him every day. Not a whit cared he
what they asked, nor was it worth while telling the
truth. When they asked he answered; saying the
things they wanted to hear. And sometimes they
gave him nickels. That was all there was about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did he live?&#8221; &#8220;What did he eat?&#8221; &#8220;Did
he work?&#8221; his inquisitors queried. &#8220;Was he married?&#8221;
and &#8220;Had he any children?&#8221; &#8220;Had he ever
killed any white men?&#8221; Then they would note his
maimed, misshapen limbs. &#8220;How long ago had his
leg been broken?&#8221; &#8220;In what way had he crippled his
hands?&#8221; But to all there were the same replies:</p>

<p>&#8220;I no know. Maybe so. I guess so.&#8221;</p>

<p>What did it matter? They were satisfied. And
meddlers they were. Yet&mdash;&mdash;generally he got the
waited-for nickel.</p>

<p>So today he answered even as they questioned. Then
the woman (pretty, and with an unmistakable air of
good breeding) nodded and said: &#8220;Good-by!&#8221; and the
man (well-mannered, well-groomed and self-complacent)
gave him a silver quarter as he went back to
the &#8220;Pullman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Henry, dear,&#8221; she asked, after they had settled
themselves comfortably again in their compartment
of the sleeping-car, &#8220;how do such creatures exist?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
Do they work, or only sit idly in the sun waiting for
someone to give them one or two nickels?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he is a confirmed beggar, one can see! They
never work&mdash;these Paiutes. Mere animals are they,
eating, drinking and sleeping as animals,&#8221; her husband
replied. &#8220;So degenerate have they become since the
days when they were a wild tribe and warriors that
they go through life now in docile stupidity, without
anything rousing them to what we would call a live
interest in their surroundings. I doubt very much if,
in the life of any one of them, there ever occurs any
stirring event. Perhaps it is just as well, for at least
it gives them a peaceful old age, and they can have
no harassing recollections.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And no happy ones, either,&#8221; the woman said.
&#8220;Think what it must be to live out one&#8217;s allotted time
of physical existence without ever experiencing the
faintest romance&mdash;without even a gleam of what love
means! I presume that the sense of attachment is
unknown to them; such affection as&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As ours?&#8221; he interrupted laughingly. &#8220;Well, rather
unknown I should say.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man looked with fond eyes into the eyes of the
woman; then, as the train pulled out of the station,
they saw the old Indian limping away toward his camp.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Are the individual histories of Indians&mdash;even Paiutes&mdash;even
the &#8220;degenerate tribes&#8221;&mdash;uneventful or
wholly devoid of human interest? Let us see.</p>

<p>Old George can tell you a different story, it may be.
From his point of view there is perhaps love; perhaps
even romance. Much depends upon the standpoint one
takes. The hills that look high from the valley, seem
low looking down from the mountain.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>When I first knew George (he was &#8220;Young George&#8221;
then), he was married and had children. Four; two
boys and two girls. More than other Indians, he
aped the Whites in their ways, and was reckoned (for
a Paiute) a decent fellow. His camp was the best, his
food the most plentiful, and his children the best kept
and cleanest. The mother sewed well, and neither she
nor the children ever went ragged. Among Indians
they were as the hard-working, temperate laborer&#8217;s
family is among the white men who work&mdash;work with
their hands for a living.</p>

<p>George had money laid by&mdash;joint earnings of his
own and of Susan, his wife. He worked at the settlers&#8217;
wood-piles in winter, chopping wood; and in
summer he worked in the hay fields. She washed and
ironed for the white families. Wage was high in
those days, and George and Susan prospered. That was
a contented little camp built there in the tall sagebrush,
and they were happy as needs be.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>There happened that which is not always confined
to the camp of the red man. It was the old story&mdash;
another woman. Well, has not the world seen such
things before? There are women&mdash;even those without
the dower of beauty&mdash;of whose strange power no explanation
can be given save that they can, and do,
&#8220;charm men.&#8221; And in no less measure was this
brown-skinned woman a charmer. She had already
parted more than one husband and wife&mdash;had destroyed
the peace and quiet of more than one home, when she
and George stood where the ways met.</p>

<p>If this had happened some three thousand years
ago, and she had lived on the banks of the Nile, and if
you were a poet, or a recorder of history, no doubt you
would have written her down a siren&mdash;a dark-eyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
charmer of men&mdash;a sorceress of Egypt; but she lived on
the Humboldt river instead, and all this happened
within the last four decades, and she was only a squaw
of one of our North American tribes. Neither was she
a pretty squaw judged by our ca&ntilde;ons of beauty. Yet
are not such things matters of geography governed by
traditions? And when a man is bewitched by a
man, brown-skinned or white, he is very apt to see
charms where another cannot discover them.</p>

<p>Sophy, the siren, came into the camp, and with her
coming fled peace. Poor Susan, unloved and deserted,
sat apart and cried her heart out&mdash;as many a white
woman has done before her, and since&mdash;when powerless
to prevent, or right the wrong that was done her.
So, bewitched and befooled, George gave himself up
to the madness that was his undoing. The money which
had been laid by went like water held in the hand.
The camp was neglected; the stores were wasted. The
children, from whom the mother had been banished,
went ragged and oftentimes hungry.</p>

<p>It took George a long time to awake from his delirium,
but he did awaken finally&mdash;after many months.
All things come&mdash;some day&mdash;to the writing of &#8220;finis.&#8221;
And no joy falls so soon and so completely as the joy
built on an unsound foundation. One day George
came to his senses. Then he cast the woman out; cast
her out, and forever. He brought back to his home the
mother of his children, and she foregave him. Well,
what would you?&mdash;she was his wife, and a woman forgives
much for the sake of the children she has held
to her breast. So the camp was made tidy again and
the children cared for as of old, and there were new
stores gathered, and money was again saved.</p>

<p>Now George&mdash;being an Indian, being a Paiute&mdash;had
never heard of Colley Cibber, else he might have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
reminded that &#8220;we shall find no fiend in hell can match
the fury of a disappointed woman&mdash;scorned! slighted!
dismissed without a parting pang.&#8221; Neither did George&mdash;being
a Paiute Indian&mdash;know the meaning of the
word &#8220;Nemesis.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was more than twenty years ago; and for more
than twenty years the woman, Sophy, made his life
a series of persecutions. If he builded aught at the
camp, it was torn down; what he raised in his garden
was destroyed; what he bought, was quickly broken.
Horses were driven far astray; and his favorite dogs
were poisoned. Then, when she had exhausted all
her ingenuity in these and a hundred other ways of
making his life a torment, she turned her wiles on
Doctor Jim, one of the great medicine men of the tribe,
married to Susan&#8217;s mother, and an inmate of George&#8217;s
camp. Doctor Jim&#8217;s long residence in the house had
given to George a certain enviable status among the
Indians, and this prestige the woman now meant to
destroy. On Doctor Jim were bestowed her blandishments,
and&mdash;like George before him&mdash;he was fain to
follow whither she led. With the medicine man&#8217;s
going, departed the glory of the house. And it left,
in the person of the deserted wife, another mouth for
George to feed; while at the same time the assisting
support which Doctor Jim had given the household was
taken away.</p>

<p>Troubles came thick and fast to Old George. He
had begun to be called &#8220;Old&#8221; George now. One day
while he was handling a cartridge it accidentally exploded
and tore away part of his hand. This hampered
him in what work he got to do; and sometimes because
of it he was refused employment. Then the evil fate
that had chosen him for a plaything, threw him from a
train running at full speed, and left him lying on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
track with broken legs, and pitifully crippled. He got
well after many weary months while Susan nursed him,
and between whiles of nursing earned the living for the
dwellers within the camp. When Spring came, Susan
died.</p>

<p>On George fell the care of the four children. It was
harder for him to work now, and there was less to be
earned; yet he worked the harder for his four. Another
year; and there were but two for him to shelter and
to feed. The great White Plague stops not at the camps
of the White man, but has hunted out the Red man in
his wick-i-up, and is fast decreasing the number of the
tribe; so two&mdash;the older two&mdash;of the children had gone
to answer its call, and George was alone with the two
that were hardly more than babies. Mourning for his
dead, he must yet work for the living.</p>

<p>We give our sympathy to the woman left widowed
who has little children looking to her for support. But
she seldom fails in her trust, for the world is usually
kind to a woman and ready to lend her aid. Rather
give of your pity to the father who has babes to provide
for when there is no woman to take up the burden
with him. He must care for the home, and must go
out in the world, as well, to work. Remember the burden
is no less hard for him to bear even so be he is an
Indian. It may not seem so to you, a white man, but
you must recollect that the Indian takes a different
point of view.</p>

<p>Long, long after his children were grown, and the
old grandmother was dead, and George was living
in his camp with grandchildren about him, the woman
came again&mdash;she, Sophy, came to him&mdash;trying to win
him back now that the woman he cared most for was
dead. Sophy at last had tired of her revenge, had tired
of jealousy and strife; had tired of everything in life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
but the one man who had once cast her off. Doctor
Jim was dead&mdash;had died many years before. And so
she came to the one she cared for still&mdash;as even she
had cared most for. For George she cared always; so
she came and stood at his door. Many snows had come
and gone since his blood had moved at her will; and
now it was too late for her influence to weigh with
him. He was old; and when he sat before the campfire
and saw a woman&#8217;s face move to and fro in the
the smoke wreaths, it was the face of the woman who
best loved him, always&mdash;not the face of the one he had
loved for a time&mdash;that he saw.</p>

<p>So she went away, and at last there was peace between
them. She died the other day. But George&mdash;Old
George&mdash;lives still, and alone. He goes to the
station day after day, as is his habit, and watches the
trains as they come in, and answers the questions of
the inquisitive travelers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If my characters were white you might call this a
love story with a bit of romance threaded in. Perhaps
you will, anyway. For it all depends upon how
you look at it. It is just a little story of what is happening
all the while everywhere in the world. Love
and jealousy; hatred and revenge. It does not very
much matter whether they live on the water side of
Beacon street (as they do who stood talking to Old
George yesterday); or whether it is in the wick-i-ups
of the sagebrush out on the great Nevada plains. These
things come into the lives of all races alike.</p>

<p>George paid for the folly of his youth, as the transgressor
usually does have to pay. If you live by the
sea in the East, you will perhaps call this a punishment
for George laid upon him as a rebuke by the &#8220;hand of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
divine Providence.&#8221; But if your home is by the Western
sea, and you have knocked about a bit on the rough
trails in the West, you will mayhap see in it only the
workings of &#8220;natural law.&#8221;</p>

<p>That is all. It is a little story, but quite true. It
might very easily have been made a White man&#8217;s
story; but it isn&#8217;t, it is only the true story of a Paiute.</p>

<p>George is an Indian; but one in a whole tribe&mdash;each
having his own story. And the tribe is but one of
the race. And the race&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Are we not brothers?</p>

<p>For, the world over, under white skin or skin of
bronze-brown, the human heart throbs the same; for
we are brothers&mdash;ay! brothers all.</p>

<p>Yet, even so, there is still the point of view.</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;HELLO, Dick!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Reddy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Seven little gray burros&mdash;browsing
upon the dust-covered chamiso&mdash;lifted
their heads at the words; and
turned seven mealy noses and seven pairs
of inquisitive ears toward the speakers in indolent curiosity.</p>

<p>The two men who met upon the mesa had been drawing
slowly together on the long white road winding
up toward the mountain a dozen miles away. The dust,
raised by the shuffling feet of their horses, floated&mdash;a
long streamer of white&mdash;down toward the muddy,
crooked river in the valley far below. The dust had
whitened, too, the slouch hats and worn blue overalls
they wore; and their faces were marked with furrows,
burned deep by the harsh, relentless sun of the
plains. It was pouring its rays down now with the
fierce malignance of some demon bent on destroying
every vestige of plant-life that had the temerity to put
forth its young shoots; and save for the scant bunch-grass,
and the sage, and the greasewood, and a few distant
and scattering junipers that grew dark upon the
mountains beyond, no growth of vegetation was to be
seen. It was within an hour of noon, and the scorching
rays descended upon the blistered earth through a silver-gray<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
haze that&mdash;reaching across the valley&mdash;quivered
over the scene like the heat that comes through an
open furnace-door.</p>

<p>Little gray lizards with black, shining eyes; little
horned toads with prickly backs, lay with palpitating
bodies in the scant shade. The saucy Paiute squirrels
which earlier in the day darted in and out of their burrows,
had now disappeared into subterranean darkness.
Jack-rabbits, with limp ears lying back, crouched under
the edges of the greasewood. The three horses stood
with listless, drooping heads; the two men sat with
listless, drooping bodies&mdash;one leaning forward to rest
his crossed arms on the horn of the Mexican saddle he
bestrode; the other, with loosely held reins between
his fingers, leaned with his elbows on his knees.</p>

<p>After the brief Western greeting, the one on the
buckskin horse asked carelessly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Been in with some hides, Reddy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What luck you been havin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor. Tell you what &#8217;tis, Dick, I ain&#8217;t seen more&#8217;n
fifty head o&#8217; horses sence we been a-campin&#8217; at Big
Deer Spring; an&#8217; the&#8217;re so wild you can&#8217;t git to within
a mile of &#8217;em. Tommy an&#8217; me are goin&#8217; to move.
They&#8217;re waterin&#8217; over to them deep springs north.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yaas,&#8221; drawled the other, &#8220;they&#8217;ve been shot among
so much they&#8217;re gittin&#8217; scarry. Me an&#8217; my pardner are
campin&#8217; over at the mine with them Dagos there; but
we don&#8217;t see many bunches of horses around, nohow.
Guess we&#8217;ll skin out next week, an&#8217; go over to The
Cedars. I don&#8217;t s&#8217;pose&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he moved his horse
nearer to the wagon, and bent a contemplative gaze
upon one of the front wheels&mdash;&#8220;I don&#8217;t s&#8217;pose Austin
an&#8217; the Kid&#8217;ll kick if we do crowd over on their lay-out
a little; for there must be near a thousand head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
o&#8217; mustangs over &#8217;round them Cedars that ain&#8217;t never
heard a gun yit. So&#8217;t there&#8217;d be good shootin&#8217; for
all of us, an&#8217; plenty o&#8217; horses to go &#8217;round. Hey?&#8221;</p>

<p>The other nodded his head affirmatively.</p>

<p>&#8220;But that Austin&#8217;s a queer sort of a feller! Wanted
him to come in with my pardner an&#8217; me (he&#8217;s an all-fired
good shot&mdash;good as I am myself; an&#8217; I c&#8217;n shoot all I
c&#8217;n skin in a day), an&#8217; I thought him an&#8217; me could do
the shootin&#8217;, an&#8217; my pardner an&#8217; the Kid could do the
skinnin.&#8217; But, no sir-ee; he wouldn&#8217;t have it! Just
said the Kid couldn&#8217;t come; an&#8217; &#8217;t two was enough in a
camp, anyway. He&#8217;s about as stand-offish as anybody
I ever see. I ain&#8217;t sorry now&#8217;t he didn&#8217;t take up with
my offer; for the boys say that the Kid wouldn&#8217;t be
no &#8217;count along anyway. He can&#8217;t shoot; and he just
nat&#8217;rally won&#8217;t skin &#8217;em&mdash;too squeamish an&#8217; ladylike.
Aw!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know. He just tags &#8217;round after Austin all day;
an&#8217; don&#8217;t never seem to want to git more&#8217;n a hunderd
yards from him. An&#8217; Austin&#8217;s just about as bad stuck
on the Kid,&#8221; said Reddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yaas, I know it; an&#8217; that&#8217;s what beats me. I don&#8217;t
see what they&#8217;re stuck so on each other for,&#8221; said
Dick, as he leaned back in the saddle and rammed
a hand into the depths of a pocket of his overalls. As
he drew forth a section of &#8220;star plug&#8221; he tapped the
buckskin&#8217;s flanks with his heels to urge the sorry specimen
of horseflesh closer to the wagon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chaw?&#8221;</p>

<p>The smaller man accepted. Turning the square over
and giving each side a cursory glance, he picked off the
tin tag&mdash;a tiny star&mdash;and set his jaws into an inviting
corner, bending it back and forth in his endeavor to
wrench off a generous mouthful. Passing it in silence
back to the owner (who regaled himself also with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
like quantity before returning it to his pocket), and
having&mdash;with the aid of thumbnail and forefinger&mdash;snapped
the shining little star at a big horse-fly that
was industriously sucking blood from the roan&#8217;s back,
he remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hides is gone up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That so?&#8221; exclaimed Dick, with animation; &#8220;what
they worth now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dollar an&#8217; a quarter, to a dollar an&#8217; six bits; and
three dollars for extra big ones. Manes is worth two
bits a pound. What you comin&#8217; in for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ca&#8217;tridges. Shot mine all away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I c&#8217;n let you have some till you git your&#8217;n, if you
want. What&#8217;s your gun&mdash;forty-five eighty-five Marlin?&#8221;
asked Reddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nope&mdash;won&#8217;t do,&#8221; answered Dick; &#8220;mine&#8217;s Remington
forty-ninety. Much &#8217;bliged, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Dick!&#8221; exclaimed Reddy, &#8220;them Mexicans
down on the river are comin&#8217; out to run mustangs. I
saw that Black Joaquin an&#8217; his brother yist&#8217;day, an&#8217;
told &#8217;em if they wanted to run &#8217;em anywheres out on
our lay-out, that we wouldn&#8217;t make no kick if they&#8217;d
let us in for a share. See? They think they c&#8217;n run
in about a hunderd an&#8217; fifty head, anyway. An&#8217; they&#8217;ll
furnish the manada, an&#8217; the saddle horses, an&#8217; all, for
the whole crowd. So, I told &#8217;em. &#8216;All right! go ahead,
as far as me an&#8217; my pardner are concerned.&#8217; He says
Austin&#8217;s agreed. How are you an&#8217; Johnny? Willin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; I&#8217;m willin&#8217;,&#8221; answered Dick, as he jerked
at the bridle-rein, disturbing the buckskin&#8217;s doze.
&#8220;Well, good luck to you! See you again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Same to yourself. So long!&#8221; answered Reddy.</p>

<p>The saddle-horse fell into a jog trot again to the
pricking of the spur; and the sorry span started the
wagon groaning and rattling on its way up the road<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
whose furrows were cut deep by the great teams that
hauled sulphur and borax from the furthest mountains
down to the railroad in the valley.</p>

<p>The creaking and rattling of the wagon had only
just recommenced, when Reddy stopped his team to
call back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Dick!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221;</p>

<p>The little burros that had returned to nibbling on the
brush, again lifted their heads at this second interruption.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say! Austin ast me to git him a San Fr&#8217;ncisco paper
so as he could see what hides is quoted at; an&#8217; I plum
clean forgot it. Wisht you&#8217;d bring out one to him
when you come!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right! So long!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So long!&#8221;</p>

<p>The men moved on again. And the two streamers of
white dust grew farther and farther apart, till they
had faded out of sight in the hazy distance.</p>

<p>The burros were left in undisturbed possession of the
mesa the rest of the stifling hot day, while they browsed
along on the greasewood. Late in the afternoon their
little hoofs turned into a wild horse trail which led
them, single-file, down to the river where the mealy
muzzles were plunged into the swift, muddy current
for a drink.</p>

<p>But while they had been munching the uninviting
brush and sage, and flicking the flies away with their
absurd paint-brush tails, Harvey Austin, over on the
foothills near the Cedars, sat in the tent which was
now the only home he knew; and with his hat fanned
the face of the one whom the horse-hunters had named
&#8220;The Kid.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy, who had been ailing, was asleep now; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
the flushed cheeks, and parched lips that were always
calling for water, were cause enough for the fear that
came over Austin as he sat there. What if this were but
the beginning of a long fever? Suppose there should
be a serious illness for him?</p>

<p>Again Austin asked himself the same questions that
he was putting to himself daily. What had the future
in store for them? From here, where were they to go?
To stay through the long winter, with the mercury below
zero, and the wild blasts of wind about their
tent&mdash;perhaps to be buried in deep snow&mdash;all these
things were not to be considered for a moment. Before
the coming of winter they must go. But where? Only
away from civilization were they safe.</p>

<p>He had come to see, at last, that they had both made
a horrible mistake of life. In the beginning of this, it
had not seemed so; things looked differently&mdash;at first.
But, at times, of late there had come a feeling of repulsion
over him for which he could not account. Was
it the aftermath of wrong-doing? Well, he must make
the best of it; it was too late to undo all that had been
done. He must bear it&mdash;the larger share&mdash;as best he
could. He said to himself that, thank God! at least he
was enough of a man to hide from the &#8220;little one&#8221;
what he himself was beginning to feel.</p>

<p>It is the great immutable law that the fruits of pleasure,
plucked by the hands of sin, shall turn to bitterness
between the lips. For sin, there is suffering; and
for wrong-doing, regret. None escape the great law of
compensation. Justice must have payment for the defiance
of her laws.</p>

<p>Austin drew his breath in sharply. Oh, merciful
God! how long was this way of living to last? Why,
he might live on thirty&mdash;forty&mdash;fifty years yet! Penniless,
what was their future to be? To return to that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
world which, through their past years, had surrounded
them with all those things that make life worth living,
would be to tempt a worse fate than awaited them here.
The desolation which spread around them in the foothills
of the bare, lonely mountains was as naught to the
humiliation of returning to the peopled places where
most would know them, yet few would choose to recognize.</p>

<p>It had not seemed that the price they would have to
pay would be so dear when first he had faced the
possible results of their rash act. Was it only a twelve-month
ago? Why, it might have been twelve times
twelve, so long ago did it seem since he was walking
among men holding his head up, and looking fearlessly
into the eyes of honest fellows who greeted him with
warm hand-clasps.</p>

<p>His face had a strained look as he let his eyes fall
on the unconscious figure beside him; and a strange expression&mdash;almost
one of aversion&mdash;swept across his features.
But he drew himself up quickly, tossing his
head back with a movement as though&mdash;by the act&mdash;he
could cast off something which might, perhaps, master
him. For some time he sat there, his sensitive, refined
face rigid and set, fixing his eyes on vacancy.
Then he sank back, sighing wearily.</p>

<p>Before him was memory&#8217;s moving panorama of a
splendid past. Out of the many pictures&mdash;plainer than
all the rest&mdash;rose the face of the man who had befriended
him; the one to whom he owed all he had ever
been, or enjoyed. The one but for whom he would have
been left, when a boy, to the chill charity of strangers.
From that generous hand he had received an education
befitting the heir to great wealth, and that noble heart
had given such love and care as few sons receive from
a parent. He could now, in recollection, see the austere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
face of his guardian softening into affectionate smiles
as his tender gaze fell on his two wards&mdash;himself, and
the pretty, willful Mildred. Only they whom he so
fondly loved knew the great depths of tenderness and
gentleness in his nature. It stung Austin now to think
of it; it shamed him as well.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And was he&mdash;this coward hiding in the mountains
of the West, leading a hateful existence hunting wild
horses for the few dollars that the hides would bring,
that he might be able to buy the necessaries of life,
since he had failed to get work in any other calling&mdash;was
he the one whom John Morton had once loved and
trusted? He shuddered with disgust; no man could
feel a greater contempt for him, than he felt for himself.</p>

<p>He rose abruptly and walked to the opening of the
tent, looking out on the sweep of sagebrush-covered
foothills about him. It was useless to think of the past,
or to give way to remorse or idle regrets. What was
done could not be undone. He must arrange, as best
he could, for the future years, and provide for the needs
of the present. He must do his best in caring for and
protecting the one for whom this life was harder&mdash;far
harder&mdash;than for himself.</p>

<p>He turned his back on the dreary landscape before
him, and came back into the tent, busying himself about
camp duties till the other awoke. And the young eyes&mdash;wistful
and sad&mdash;that kept seeking Austin&#8217;s, saw no
trace of the heartache and remorse he was bravely
trying to bury.</p>

<p>When the sun had gone down behind their mountain,
and a welcome coolness had settled itself over the
burning ground, they went to sit by the spring that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
bubbled out of the hillside. All through the twilight
they sat without speaking, their thoughts far away.
Then darkness came and hid the barren hills, mercifully
shutting from their sight the pitiful poverty of
the life that was now theirs. A soft west wind sprung
up; and the balmy night air, cool and dry, seemed to
have driven away much of the illness the boy had felt
through the day. They sat in a silence unbroken only
by the crickets&#8217; perpetual shrilling, the hoot of a
ground owl, and a coyote yelping to its mate across
the ca&ntilde;on. When the first prolonged cry pierced the
air, the slight form had nestled instinctively closer to
Austin. Then the mournful wail of the little gray
ghost of the plains grew fainter and fainter, and finally
ceased altogether, as he trotted away over the ridge, in
quest of a freshly-skinned carcass where some unfortunate
horse had fallen a victim to the sure aim of some
horse hunter.</p>

<p>They sat for nearly an hour in the silence of night
in the mountains, Austin wondering if the time would
ever come when the &#8220;little one&#8221; would guess how miserably
tired of it he had become in less than a year. He
hoped&mdash;prayed, the other would never know. And
(worse still) would a sickening disgust ever find its
way into that other heart, as it had into his own? With
all his soul he silently prayed it might never be so.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, little one,&#8221; he said, gently, &#8220;we must go in.
It is late.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other made no response.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to go yet? Are you not sleepy&mdash;and
a little bit tired, poor child?&#8221;</p>

<p>Still no answer, though Austin knew he was heard.
He waited. Then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Harvey,&#8221;&mdash;the voice was almost a whisper&mdash;&#8220;we
have seen some happy days&mdash;sometimes&mdash;and you have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
always been good to me; but, do you&mdash;&mdash; I mean,
when you remember what we have lost, and what we
are and must always remain, do you find in this life
we are living, compensation enough for all that we suffer?
Do you? Tell me!&#8221;</p>

<p>So! it had come to the other one, too.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A day of fast, hard riding had drawn to its close.
Reddy and Dick, and their &#8220;pardners,&#8221; and Black
Joaquin and his brother, together with two or three
others had made their first day&#8217;s run of wild mustangs.
Three or four &#8220;bunches&#8221; of native wild horses had
been surrounded and driven with a rush, in a whirl
of alkali dust, into a juniper corral far down in the
ca&ntilde;on. Then the circling riatas had brought them&mdash;bucking
and kicking&mdash;down to the earth; and biting
and striking at their captors, they fought for their
liberty till exhausted and dripping with sweat&mdash;their
heads and knees skinned and mouths bleeding&mdash;they
found themselves conquered, necked to gentler horses,
or else hoppled.</p>

<p>At early morning Dick had come to Austin&#8217;s camp,
bringing the newspaper; and the two had ridden away
together. And now that each man had made his selection
in the division of the day&#8217;s spoils, Austin turned
his pony&#8217;s head toward the far-off tent&mdash;a little white
speck in the light of the sunset on one of the distant
foothills.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, good-night, boys! I&#8217;ll join you again in the
morning.&#8221; He loped away to the place where the
&#8220;little one&#8221; was awaiting him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The morrow&#8217;s sun shone blood-red&mdash;an enormous
ruby disc, in the east through the smoky haze that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
hung over the valley still. By eight o&#8217;clock the air
was stifling, and the men standing about camp ready
for the second day&#8217;s run were impatient to be off.
It was easier to endure the heat when in the saddle
and in action, than to be idling here at the corral. They
were wondering at Austin&#8217;s delay. And most of them
had been swearing. Finally, Black Joaquin was told
to go across to the white speck on the foothills, and
&#8220;hustle him up;&#8221; for they were short of men to do
the work, if he did not come. So the Mexican threw
himself across the saddle, and digging his spurs into
the flanks of the ugly-looking sorrel, loped over the hill
to Austin&#8217;s camp.</p>

<p>Half an hour later he came back at racing speed to
tell a story which made the men look at each other
with startled glances, and even with suspicion at himself
(so surely are evil deeds laid at the door of one
with an evil reputation); but when they rode over to
where the stilled forms lay beside the rifle whose aim
had been true, they saw it had not been Black Joaquin.</p>

<p>Who, then? Too plainly, they saw. But why?</p>

<p>The newspaper Dick had brought lay folded open at
an article that told the pitiful story of their love, and
their sin, and their shame. It was Johnny, Dick&#8217;s partner,
who saw it, and read:</p>

<p>&#8220;Living among Horse Hunters&mdash;An Erring Couple
Traced to Nevada&mdash;Harvey Ashton and Mrs. John Q.
Morton Seen&mdash;The Woman in Male Attire.</p>

<p>&#8220;The public no doubt remembers press dispatches of
a year ago from Boston, regarding the sensational elopement
of Harvey Ashton and the young and beautiful
wife of John Q. Morton, a prominent and wealthy
commission merchant of that city. All parties concerned
moved in the most exclusive circles of society.</p>

<p>&#8220;Young Ashton had returned home from a prolonged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
tour of Europe to find that Morton (who, though not
related to him, has always assumed the part of an indulgent
father) had just wedded his ward, Miss Mildred
Walters, a handsome young woman many years
his junior; and whose play-fellow he&mdash;Ashton&mdash;had
been when a boy, but whom she had not seen for a number
of years. She had matured into a beautiful, attractive
woman, and Ashton soon fell a willing victim
to her charms. Soon after, society of the Hub was
startled and shocked to hear of the elopement of Harvey
Ashton with his benefactor&#8217;s wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;Subsequently they were discovered to have been
in San Francisco, where all traces of them, for the time,
were lost. Nothing was heard of them again till, some
two months ago, when they were seen in Reno, Nevada,
by an old acquaintance who cannot be mistaken in
their identity.</p>

<p>&#8220;He states he had come down from Virginia City,
and was waiting to take the train for the East, when
he saw Ashton pass by the station once or twice, in
company with what was apparently a small, slightly-built
young man, but who, he is positive, is none other
than Mrs. Morton in male attire. He purposely avoided
the couple, but inquiries elicited the facts that Ashton
was passing under the name of Austin, and had stated
that his companion was a young brother. It was also
learned that they were practically without means, and
were leaving Reno for the interior part of the State.
Later reports locate them in a range of mountains a
short distance from the railroad, where they are with
a number of cowboys and sheep-herders who are out
of work, and who are at present engaged in shooting
wild horses, furnishing hides for the San Francisco
market.</p>

<p>&#8220;The friend who recognized the couple at once communicated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
with the deserted husband, who, it is reported,
is on his way West in quest of the erring pair.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This was their story, then! The story waiting in the
newspaper for Austin when he got back to the &#8220;little
one&#8221; the evening before.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The afternoon&#8217;s shadows were slanting down the
valley when the seven little burros saw Reddy&#8217;s wagon
come down the long, dusty road leading toward the
river. From where they browsed they could see it go
over the bridge and the alkali flats, on its way to the
railroad station in the hazy valley. The big sheet of
canvas, taken from Dick&#8217;s bed, covered something that
lay in the bottom of the wagon. Two somethings there
were&mdash;side by side, rigid and cold&mdash;sharply outlined
under the folds of white canvas.</p>

<p>The wagon creaked, and rattled, and groaned on
its way. The afternoon sun parched and burned the
earth, as it had done for weeks. Rabbits hid under
the edges of the greasewood on the side where the
greater shadows fell. The burros still flicked with
their absurd tails at the sand-flies. Buzzing above
the canvas were some big green flies that followed the
wagon till after the sun went down. A buzzard circled
overhead; and a lean coyote trotted behind the
wagon on the mesa for a mile or more.</p>

<p>The burros, too, crossed the bridge that night, and
morning found them browsing along the foothills nestling
against the mountains across the valley, where
feed was better. Near the base of the mountain, and
not far from the little railroad station, was a graveyard.
Treeless, flowerless, unfenced. There were no
headstones, &#8217;tis true; but the graves were well banked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
with broken rock, to keep the hungry coyotes and
badgers from digging up the dead.</p>

<p>At the station Black Joaquin had helped lift the new
pine boxes into the wagon. As he watched them start
on their ride to the place of rock-covered mounds near
the foothills, he said to the men gathered about:</p>

<p>&#8220;Por Dios! Not so muchos hombres to shoot mostang
now!&#8221;</p>

<p>And his brother Domingo, who had been drinking,
answered with more freedom:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Sta &#8217;ueno! Not so muchos hombres; more mostang
por me. &#8217;Sta &#8217;ueno; si, &#8217;sta muy &#8217;ueno!&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed slyly. Then he went over to the saloon,
followed by the other men.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The little gray burros watched the wagon for a long
time, as it went rattle&mdash;rattle&mdash;rattle over the stony
road. By and by it stopped. Then they began nibbling
again on the scant bunch-grass and white sage.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;BLOCKHEAD! idiot! ass! &#8216;Tenderfoot&#8217;
isn&#8217;t adequate for such a fool as I have
been!&#8221; he exclaimed bitterly.</p>

<p>He tried not to care; even he tried to
forget that the good-looking, successful
mining engineer had given him a title
which had made him wince: &#8220;the deckle-edged tenderfoot!&#8221;
But it stung, nevertheless. Perhaps the reason
that it hurt, was because of its fitness. And what hurt
more, was the fact Cadwallader had taken pains that
Evaleen Blaine should hear it said&mdash;Cadwallader, who
seemed so well fitted to take his place in the rough
Western way of battling with life, where he himself
did but blunder and stumble, and earn the name of &#8220;the
deckle-edged tenderfoot!&#8221; That Teamster Bill had
christened him &#8220;this yer gentlemanly burro frum Bost&#8217;n,&#8221;
cut far less keenly. But then, Bill wasn&#8217;t trying
to move heaven and earth to get Miss Blaine. Whereas
Elwyn Cadwallader was.</p>

<p>However, on all sides opinion was the same, if differently
expressed. The fact of his being a gentleman
had not prevented him from becoming a fool&mdash;chiefest
of fools&mdash;else he never would have trusted
so implicitly in old Zeke Runkle&#8217;s misrepresentations
of the group of mining claims in those foothills that
lay just below the Monarch group. The Monarch was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
the talk of the camp for its richness. If there was a
fortune in the one group (he argued to himself), then
why not also in those so nearly adjoining. At any rate,
it seemed to him it was his one chance to find a fortune
by a short cut; so, paying for them with all he
had, save a few hundreds that afterwards went for useless
development work, the mines became his. The
camp welcomed him into its midst, and winked, and
grinned when he wasn&#8217;t looking; and (to a man) voted
him &#8220;an easy thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes not having been focused for fraud, he
never doubted but that the rich samples shown him
had come from the mines represented; nor ever suspected
that, under his very eyes, the tests he himself
made had been tampered with.</p>

<p>Old Zeke Runkle&#8217;s annual swindles had been a camp
joke for a score of years; but Sherwood&mdash;being an in-experienced
stranger&mdash;saw only in him an honest (if
usually drunken) prospector. A kindly, if simple, old
man, too; for Zeke had generously made him a gift of
an entire mining claim which had not been included in
the original number&mdash;one quite distinct from the original
group. True, it seemed to be but an undeveloped
claim&mdash;its one tunnel only running in ten or fifteen
feet. And the gift had been tendered him at the suggestion
of Cadwallader, from whom Sherwood was
surprised to receive evidence of a kindly feeling which
had not been previously displayed. That this unusual interest
in him had surprised old Zeke, too, was plain; for
he seemed puzzled at first, as though it were not possible
for him to comprehend Cadwallader&#8217;s meaning.
After a few whispered words from the younger man,
however, Zeke&#8217;s face had brightened with understanding,
and he turned to Sherwood insisting he must accept
it. The unexpected part Cadwallader had taken,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
and the old man&#8217;s unselfish attitude, showed to Sherwood
such a fine glimpse of Western good-fellowship
that he warmed to the place and the people as he
had done at no time before. It turned the scale and
the bargain was closed.</p>

<p>So he became sole owner of the seven mines on the
sagebrush-covered hills, that comprised the Golden
Eagle group; and of the one isolated claim in the foot
of the bluffs that rose abruptly at the edge of an old-time
ruined mining camp which had been deserted for
more than thirty years.</p>

<p>It lay there in a ca&ntilde;on where once men came in
search of precious metals; and in that cleft of the
mountains they built their homes. Along the ca&ntilde;on
sides, from end to end, there trailed a double line of
houses, now all in ruins&mdash;fallen walls of adobe or stone.
Roofless and floorless, with empty casements and doorways,
the houses stood mute witnesses of the false
hopes which once led men to squander money, and
youth, and strength of purpose there in the long-ago,
when the State was new.</p>

<p>Almost a double score of years had gone since the
place knew human voice or human movement, save
when some lone prospector passed along the brush-grown
street that crept upward with the ca&ntilde;on&#8217;s slope.
The dead town&#8217;s very stillness and desolation were full
of charm, albeit tempered with that sadness a ruin always
has for the beholder. For through the empty
doorways came the whisperings of those who were
gone; and looking through the sashless windows as
you rode by, you saw wraithlike figures pass and repass
within. It might have been only the wind&#8217;s
breath as it rustled the dark leaves of branches overhanging
the crumbling walls, and the ghosts, mayhap,
were but the waving boughs which tremulously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
moved over the gray adobes; but when you were there&mdash;in
that stillness and amid all that mystery&mdash;you felt
it was true. You hushed your quickening breath to listen
for the breath of some other. You moved through
the silence with wide-lidded eyes looking for&mdash;you
knew not what. You felt yourself out of place there&mdash;an
alien. Only the lizards on the decaying walls,
and the little brown birds that pecked at berries growing
on the bushes along the creek, and the cottontails
that scurried away to hide in the brush, seemed to
have honest claim there.</p>

<p>On a level with the dead camp&#8217;s one street, the
short tunnel of the Spencer mine ran into the cliff which
pushed itself forward from the ca&ntilde;on&#8217;s general contour&mdash;the
mouth itself being all but hidden by the falling
walls of what had once been an adobe dwelling, its
rear wall but a few feet from the limestone bluffs. To
it, old Zeke brought Sherwood and showed him the tunnel
below and the croppings of white quartz on the
cliff top. It looked barren and worthless; but an assay
certificate, in which the values were marked in four
figures, held before Sherwood&#8217;s astonished eyes, sent
his hopes up to fever mark, and left him eager to begin
the work whereby he might reach the precious stuff
hidden well away within the dull-colored bluffs. If the
croppings promised such wealth, what might not the
mine itself yield when he extended the tunnel, and
had tapped the ledge at a greater depth? He felt
his heart beating the faster for his dreams. A fortune!
His, and&mdash;hers! All that was needed to bring
it about were pick strokes, powder and patience. It all
seemed very simple to Hume Sherwood. Without doubt
he was a &#8220;tenderfoot.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the Summer found him putting every pulse-throb
into his labor. Was it not for her that he wanted it?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
For what other end was he working, than to win the
maid who had come into this land of enchantment?
To him, it was as Paradise&mdash;these great broad levels
of alkali, and sand (blotches of white on a blur of gray)
and the sagebrush and greasewood-covered foothills
that lay, fold upon fold, against the base of grim mountains&mdash;prickly
with splintered and uncovered rocks.</p>

<p>Each day he blessed the fate which had called her
from her home by the Western sea and placed her under
the same roof that sheltered him in the rough little Nevada
camp that called itself a town since a railroad
had found it, and given it a name.</p>

<p>Here Judge Blaine and his daughter settled themselves
for the Summer. That is, an array of suit-cases
and handbags, great and small, and a trunk or two,
proclaimed the hotel their headquarters. That was
all. Every day saw the Judge up near the top of the
mountain, getting the Monarch&#8217;s new machinery into
running order; while trails, and roads&mdash;old and new&mdash;and
even the jack-rabbit paths that lay like a network
over the land, saw more of the young woman in
khaki than ever the hotel did, so long as daylight
lasted&mdash;the light which she grudged to have go.</p>

<p>It was Evaleen herself who had suggested coming
to Nevada with her father, instead of spending the
season in the usual way with Mrs. Blaine and the
other girls at whatsoever place fashion might dictate
as the Summer&#8217;s especial (and expensive) favorite for
the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daddy, dear,&#8221; she had said, standing behind his
chair, with both arms tight clasped around his neck,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve made up my mind to do something that is going
to surprise you. Listen; I&#8217;m not going with Mamma
and the girls when she shuts up the house for the Summer.
But, I&mdash;am&mdash;going&mdash;with&mdash;you! Oh, yes, I am!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
No, no! Not a word! I&#8217;ve always wanted to know
what a mining camp was like; and this is my golden
opportunity. You know you do want me there. Say
so! While you are putting up the new works, I can go
roaming over the country in old clothes. Listen to that,
Daddy&mdash;old clothes! A lovely Summer; and not a cent
spent on gowns!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ways and means at just that time being matters of
difficult solution with the Judge, her argument had
force and bore fruit. Midsummer found them where
the alkali plains stretched away to distant ranges, and
the duns and drabs of valleys reached across to the
blended purples and blues. Such distances! And such
silence! She had never dreamed of their like before.</p>

<p>On the levels or on the heights, she was day by day
finding life a new and a beautiful thing. It was all
so good; so fresh, and sweet, and strong! How easily
she had fitted into her new surroundings and the new
order of things&mdash;crude though they were, beyond any
of her preconceived ideas. And now how far away
seemed all the other Summers she had ever known.
She felt that, after all, this was the real life. The
other (that which Jean and Lili had their part in) was
to her, now, as something known only in a dream. She
was learning a grander, fuller sense of living since all
that other world was shut away. So (companioned by
her would-be lovers, Hume Sherwood and Elwyn Cadwallader,
through a Summer of glad, free, full indrawn
breaths) she rode the days away, while under
the campaign hat she wore her face was being browned
by the desert winds. Hot winds. But, oh, how she
had learned to love their ardent touch! No sun was
ever too hot, nor road too rough or long, to keep
her back from this life in the open; and in the saddle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
she had come to know the valleys and mountains as one
born to them.</p>

<p>The ca&ntilde;on which held the ruined walls had for her
an especial charm, and toward it she often turned her
horse&#8217;s head. It lay but a short distance from the road
leading to her father&#8217;s mines. So, turning aside, she
often took this short cut through the deserted town.
There, one day she heard from Cadwallader the story
of Crazy Dan, whose home had once been within the
walls that hid the entrance to the tunnel of the Spencer&mdash;the
mine which had been a gift to Sherwood.</p>

<p>Daniel Spencer&mdash;Crazy Dan (for whom old Zeke
named the claim he had given away, because on the
very ground there Dan had made his home) had
worked in the creek for placer gold during all the long
gone years when others worked the higher ground for
silver lodes. An ill-featured, ill-natured old man, having
no friends, and seeking none; he had burrowed the
ca&ntilde;on&#8217;s length for gold as persistently as a gopher does
the ground for roots, and&mdash;as all had prophesied&mdash;with
as little showing of the yellow metal. Only a crazy
man, they said, would ever have prospected that ca&ntilde;on
for gold. It was a ca&ntilde;on for ledges, not placers; for
silver, not gold. So the miserly, morose old man followed
a phantom to the last; working alone from day-dawn
till dusk with rocker and pan, in ground that
pitying neighbors vainly tried to lead him away from.
Admitting he had never found gold, yet working day
after day, Crazy Dan could be seen there for twelve
long years. Twelve years of toil that showed no reward
for his labor. Then he died. One morning they
saw there was no smoke issuing from the cabin chimney;
and guessing what they would find, they pushed
the door open.</p>

<p>Death had come when he was alone; there had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
none to close the staring eyes. He had been near to
starvation; there was scarcely any food within the
cabin; there were no comforts. Years of toiling for
something that was always just beyond; and a lonely
death at the end&mdash;that was the story.</p>

<p>As she heard, Miss Blaine was stirred with a profound
pity. When Cadwallader ceased speaking, her
thoughts went straying to those far days, in wonder of
the man who made up the sum of the town&#8217;s life.
Dead, or scattered to the four corners of the earth.
Crazy Dan&#8217;s death was no more pathetic, perhaps, than
that of many another of their number. She rode on in
silence, saddened by the recital.</p>

<p>Suddenly Cadwallader&#8217;s ringing laugh startled her.
But as quickly he checked himself, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg of you, Miss Blaine, don&#8217;t misjudge me. I
wasn&#8217;t thinking then of poor old Dan&#8217;s tragic death, or
more than tragic life. I happened to remember the sequel
to this story; and which, I&#8217;m sure, you&#8217;ve never
heard. Let me tell you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He hesitated. &#8220;Or, no;
you&#8217;ve heard enough for today, and its humor would
jar now on what you&#8217;ve just heard. I&#8217;ll tell you some
other time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing more was said about it by either; but she
felt confident it related in some way to Hume Sherwood
and the Spencer mine.</p>

<p>The latter had kept men continuously at work on his
newly acquired property since coming into possession
of them; but the faith that was his in the beginning,
grew fainter with the waning of Summer. Autumn
brought decided doubt. With the coming of Winter
came a certainty of their worthlessness, he knew he
had been befooled by a sharp trickster, but how far
his ignorance had been played upon he did not yet
know. Nevertheless, he felt he had well earned the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
titles the camp had bestowed on him, for the claims, he
found, were but relocations that had been abandoned
years before as utterly worthless. He had simply
thrown his dollars into the deep sea.</p>

<p>If only that had been all!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Evaleen Blaine and her father, contrary to all their
earlier plans for a return to San Francisco at the beginning
of Autumn, were still in Nevada, and there
Winter found them, though the machinery was all
placed and the big reservoir and dam completed. But
an offer to buy the Monarch property&mdash;mines, mill, and
all that went with them&mdash;had come from a New York
syndicate, and the Judge was now detained by their
agents. He must stay yet a few days more&mdash;then
home to &#8220;mother and the girls.&#8221; Nor would Evaleen
leave without him; so for the first time in all his married
life he was to be away from home on Christmas.
Thus matters stood when the greater half of December
had gone.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A storm was brewing. There had been scarcely
any rain or snow thus far, but a damp wind from the
south had shut away the mountain behind dark and
threatening clouds. The Judge found he was needed
at the mine that morning, but had promised Evaleen
he would be back the next night, to make Christmas
eve as merry as possible for them both&mdash;separated from
the others. By staying one night at the mine he could,
without doubt, return on the morrow. He had kissed
her good-bye and left her looking out of the window
in the gloom of the early day. Fifteen minutes
later she heard his heavy tread again on the stairs,
and he stormed into the room.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>&#8220;See here, daughter!&#8221; he panted in indignation,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve just heard of the &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; (I beg your pardon,
child); I mean the shameful trick that that cur of a
Zeke Runkle played on young Sherwood. Sherwood
has just told me&mdash;just heard of it himself. Have you
heard anything about it? No? Well, I thought not&mdash;I
thought not! It seems everybody around the place,
though, has known of it all along&mdash;but us. Why
didn&#8217;t anybody tell me? Hey? What? Yes; but why
didn&#8217;t anybody tell me, I want to know! Ah, they
knew better. I&#8217;d have told Sherwood that he&#8217;d been
played for a sucker! Yes, sir!&#8221; (forgetting his audience
again) &#8220;and a &mdash;&mdash; shame it is, too! There
I go again&mdash;but I don&#8217;t know when anything has so
worked me up!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Daddy, what is it?&#8221; faltered Evaleen. &#8220;What
has happened? I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What has happened?&#8221; shouted the Judge. &#8220;Everything
has happened&mdash;everything. Of course, you don&#8217;t
understand. I don&#8217;t, myself&mdash;all of it. Somebody (I
haven&#8217;t found out yet who, but I will!) put up that
miserable old rascal&mdash;that drunken thief of a Zeke Runkle&mdash;to
palming off on Sherwood as a bona fide mine,
the worst fake I ever heard of. Hey? What? Why!
a dug-out, I tell you&mdash;a hole in the cliff&mdash;a tunnel-like
cellar-above-ground, if you want, that Crazy Dan, it
seems, used to store away bacon, and flour, and potatoes
in, more than thirty years ago. Just an old store-room,
nothing else. That&#8217;s what! Made him a present
of it (the foxy old rascal) so the law couldn&#8217;t touch
him. Oh, he&#8217;s a clever swindler! I&#8217;m sorry for Sherwood&mdash;mighty
sorry for him. I like the fellow; there&#8217;s
good stuff in him. It&#8217;s a &mdash;&mdash; A&mdash;hum! But, for
the life of me I can&#8217;t see old Zeke&#8217;s object; for he made
nothing by it. Somebody must have put him up to it&mdash;mark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
my words. And I&#8217;d like to know who.&#8221;</p>

<p>Who had done it? Evaleen was again hearing Cadwallader&#8217;s
laugh, and the words, &#8220;An amusing sequel
to the story.&#8221; And &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you some day.&#8221; He
need not tell her now. She knew; and she knew why.</p>

<p>All that day she stayed within her room. She felt
she couldn&#8217;t see Sherwood in his humiliation; and Cadwallader
she wouldn&#8217;t see.</p>

<p>That evening when she went down to dinner she was
purposely late that she might avoid both men. Elwyn
Cadwallader was out of town, she learned, called away
unexpectedly on business. Hume Sherwood, after having
been with her father all day, up on the mountain,
had just returned&mdash;going directly to his room. He
had declined dinner.</p>

<p>Almost any man can bear censure, but it takes a
giant to brave ridicule.</p>

<p>When Miss Blaine went back to her room she found
two letters awaiting her. She read the first with the
angry blood mounting to her forehead, and lips tightened
into a straight, hard line. It was from Cadwallader.
He closed by saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me the one thing I most want in all the world!
I will go to you Christmas morning for it&mdash;for your
&#8216;yes!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Blaine&#8217;s face was very stern as with quick,
firm steps she walked across the floor to the stove in
which a fire was burning cheerily. She opened the
door and flung the letter into the flames.</p>

<p>The letter from her father was hurriedly scrawled,
&#8220;so that Sherwood can take it down to you,&#8221; it said.
There were but a dozen brief sentences: He couldn&#8217;t
be with her, after all, on Christmas eve&mdash;he had about
closed the deal with Akerman, and there was much
business to settle up. She was to pack their suit-cases<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
and trunks at once; to be ready to start home any day.
He hoped (didn&#8217;t know&mdash;but hoped) to leave the evening
of Christmas day, etc. There was a postscript:
&#8220;Akerman (acting on my advice) bought Sherwood&#8217;s
little group today for seven hundred and fifty dollars;
which is just seven hundred and fifty dollars more than
they are worth&mdash;as mining claims. But Akerman wants
the ground for other purposes, and will use it in connection
with his other property. I&#8217;m glad for the boy&#8217;s
sake he got it, for I guess Sherwood needed the money.
Of course he hasn&#8217;t said so (he&#8217;s too much of a thoroughbred
to whimper) but I don&#8217;t believe he has a
nickel left.&#8221;</p>

<p>Evaleen Blaine laid the letter down with a tender
smile on her face. &#8220;Dear old Daddy!&#8221; she murmured.
She understood the sympathetic heart which had been
the factor in bringing about the sale of Sherwood&#8217;s
claims. &#8220;Oh, Daddy, you&#8217;re good&mdash;good! I love you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Four or five hours after, she had finished packing
and got up from where she had been kneeling, and
looked about the room. Everything was folded away
in place and awaiting the turning of the key, except
the khaki suit and the wide-brimmed hat. She would
soon be miles and miles away from Nevada and its
joys. A very sober face looked out at her from the
mirror, making her force her thoughts into other channels.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not spend Christmas eve with you, Daddy? &#8217;Deed,
an&#8217; I will! I&#8217;ll just astonish you tomorrow morning!&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed to herself in anticipation of his surprise.
Then her face sobered, remembering that&mdash;for
the first time&mdash;she would make the trip alone. She
knew every inch of the way. She wasn&#8217;t afraid; there
was nothing to harm her. And by taking her coffee
and toast by lamplight, she would be with him by nine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
o&#8217;clock. As she fell asleep that night she was wishing
some good fortune might come to Hume Sherwood,
making his Christmas eve less lonely.</p>

<p>When day broke, though as yet no rain was falling,
a storm was already gathering itself for the onslaught.
Fine dust filled the air, and the wind was racing up the
valley with the swiftness of a prairie fire, where, on
the alkali flats, great breakers of white dust rose from
the sea of dry storm that ran ahead of the rain. Dead
branches of greasewood, tumble-weeds light as sea-spume
on the waves of the wind, rabbit-brush wrenched
from the roots&mdash;these (the drift-wood of desert seas),
were swept on and away!</p>

<p>In the gray early dawn Miss Blaine&#8217;s horse had been
saddled under protest.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re a-goin&#8217; to hev a Nevady zephyr, I&#8217;m
a-thinkin&#8217;, an&#8217; th&#8217; house is a mighty good place f&#8217;r
wimmin-folks &#8217;bout now!&#8221; were the words she heard
through the whistling wind as she mounted.</p>

<p>There was something electric in the strange storm
that drew her into its midst&mdash;some kinship that called
her away! She was sure she could reach shelter before
the rain reached her. &#8220;Then, hurrah for the
ring of the bridle-rein&mdash;away, brave steed, away!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mountain Boy snuffed at the dust-laden air and
broke into the long stride that soon carried them into
the foothills. At times the wind nearly swept her
from the saddle, but she loped on and on. Then she
gained the high ground; and the dust that had smarted
her eyes and nostrils lay far below. It was misty, and
the wind came in strong buffetings. Up, and still up
they climbed. The rain-clouds were surely keeping
their burden back for her! But, nay! she had almost
reached the mill&mdash;was almost under shelter, when the
storm swept down upon her and the waters fell in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
flood. Drenched and disheveled she reached the mill.
Disappointment and consternation awaited her&mdash;her
father was not there! Nearly two hours before&mdash;just
the time she was leaving the valley&mdash;the Judge, with
Mr. Akerman, had driven away by the north road to
take the morning express from the station above, and
were now at the county seat thirty miles away, if they
had met with no mishap.</p>

<p>Evaleen was aghast! What to do? Her father believed
her to be at the hotel, to which place she must
return at once&mdash;there was nothing else for her to do.
Back through the wind and the wet! She heard the
foreman&#8217;s voice in warning and entreaty swept away by
the gale as she turned; but&mdash;shaking her head&mdash;she
plunged down the road and back into the storm. Away
and away! The road ran with many a curve and turn&mdash;easy
grades, made for wagon use&mdash;; so, though
steep it was for such riding, she loped down the mountain,
while the wind, and the rain, and the roar of the
storm shut the world away.</p>

<p>A feeling of numbness came over her, a something
that was neither terror nor awe, yet which held something
of each. As time went on she seemed to have
been riding hours innumerable&mdash;it seemed days since
she had seen a human face. Down, farther down must
she go. She was becoming exhausted, and the sleet
was chilling her to the very center of her being. It
was terrible&mdash;terrible! To reach the valley and shelter!
There on the mountain the wind shrieked and
howled about her; the air was filled with voices that
were deafening, dizzying, frightful. The horse himself
was half mad with fright. Twice he had almost
thrown her as thunder claps and flashes of lightning
had seemed to surround them on all sides. Three
miles yet to shelter! Could she stand it? But where&mdash;where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
was there nearer relief? Ah! the Spencer tunnel&mdash;&mdash; There
would be safety there till the worst
of the storm was over. A turn of the rein, and Mountain
Boy was running straight for the old tunnel under
the cliffs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hark! What was that? There came to her ears
a great roaring that was neither the howling of the
wind, nor the rush of the rain, nor the mingled awful
sounds of the storm as she tore along the ca&ntilde;on. She
could see nothing of the thing she heard, for the wet
slap of the rain blinded her. Closer and closer it
came! As she slipped from the saddle at the tunnel&#8217;s
mouth, the horse&mdash;terrified at the roaring which rose
above the voice of the storm, and which was coming
nearer&mdash;broke from her, and was off and away, with a
ten-foot wall of water racing at his heels. The overtaxed
dam had bursted its bounds, and the flood was
cutting a waterway down the center of the ca&ntilde;on, but
below the level of the old tunnel! She was safe! But&mdash;&mdash;alone,
and her horse was gone!</p>

<p>When, more than two hours afterward, Hume Sherwood
found her, it seemed the most natural thing in the
world that he should take her in his arms, and her
head should lie on his breast, while she told him how
it had happened. Without question he claimed her as
his own; without a word she gave him her troth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew you would come, Hume&mdash;I knew you would
find me,&#8221; she said, softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So simply were they plighted to one another; so
easily does a great danger sweep away all disguises.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the riderless bay had come into camp, Sherwood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
(half mad with an awful fear) had hurried away
to the hills, lashing his span without mercy over the
storm-washed road&mdash;or out through the open country
where the road was gullied out. When in the up-piled
drift where the flood had left it&mdash;he found the gray
campaign hat he knew so well, a sickening fear fell
upon him as though he had already looked upon the
face of the dead. At length he thought of the tunnel,
after fruitless search elsewhere; and there&mdash;in the dug-out
that had been palmed off on him as a joke on his
credulity, he found his heart&#8217;s desire. After all, Spencer&#8217;s
old store-room&mdash;his cellar-above-ground&mdash;was
worth a king&#8217;s ransom&mdash;when valued by this man and
this maid.</p>

<p>The waters had gone down, but left the tunnel entrance
flooded; for the fallen walls of the old adobe
created a small dam which the flood overflowed. To
get past this&mdash;without wading knee-deep in the mud&mdash;was
a problem. The whirling waters had eaten away
the earth which formed the front part of the tunnel&mdash;wider
now by two feet&mdash;and in the place where the
earth had melted away stood a small box. Sherwood
put his foot against it, to pry it out of the mud.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get this out for you to stand on, dear; then
you can jump across I think, with my help.&#8221;</p>

<p>But, deep settled into the mud and debris, it resisted
him. He went back in the tunnel and got a pick from
among the tools he had used in extending the &#8220;cellar&#8221;
to strike the ledge that wasn&#8217;t there; for the &#8220;croppings&#8221;
that had been shown him had been hauled there&mdash;salted,
to deceive the &#8220;tenderfoot.&#8221;</p>

<p>The box refused to move, even when Sherwood&#8217;s
pick&mdash;used as a lever&mdash;was applied; so, swinging it
over his head, he brought the pick down into the box,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
shattering the lid into pieces. It was more than half
filled with small rusty tin cans, bearing soiled and
torn labels, on which were the printed words in colors
still bright: &#8220;Preston &amp; Merrill&#8217;s Yeast Powder.&#8221;
A case of baking powder of a sort popular five-and-thirty
years before. Strange!</p>

<p>Sherwood laughed. &#8220;We&#8217;ve found some of Crazy
Dan&#8217;s stores!&#8221; and attempted to take one of the little
cans. It lifted like lead. He stopped&mdash;afraid to put
it to the test&mdash;and looked at Evaleen queerly; and she
(remembering the story she had heard of Dan&#8217;s persistence
in working the ca&ntilde;on for placer gold) gave a
little cry as he started to open it. It seemed too much
to dare to believe&mdash;to hope for&mdash;&mdash; Yet&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>He lifted the lid. Gold! The gold dust that Crazy
Dan (ay! Miser Dan) had, back in the dead years,
hoarded away in the safest place he knew; adding to it
month after month, as he delved, and died with his secret
still his own.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Judge was at the County Seat&mdash;at the station
buying his ticket to go back to his &#8220;little girl&#8221;&mdash;when
the train from the West came in. In the dusk he
caught a glimpse of a tailor-made suit which seemed
familiar to his eye, and that made him look twice at
the wearer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why! Bless my soul, child&mdash;and Sherwood, too!
Well! Well! What are you doing here? I wrote to
you about it. Didn&#8217;t you get my message, Evy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Daddy, dear; you said: &#8216;Be at the station tonight
ready to go home&mdash;I start from here.&#8217; But as
everything was packed I thought I&#8217;d come up and
join you, and we could both start from here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; added Sherwood, after they had gone into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
the now empty waiting-room, &#8220;I wanted to see you, sir,
before you left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, of course! Glad you came to see me off,
Sherwood. You must come down to see us, you know;
and meet mother and the girls. We&#8217;ll&mdash;&mdash; Eh!
What&#8217;s that? * * * What! * * * Evy&mdash;my little girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Judge stuttered and stammered, bewildered at
the suddenness of the attack.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sherwood talked long and earnestly; and the Judge&#8217;s
eyes wandered to the daughter who had, until now,
never seemed other than his &#8220;little girl.&#8221; But she had
&#8220;grown up&#8221; under his unseeing eyes; and now somebody
wanted to take her from him. Sherwood&mdash;&mdash; Well,
Sherwood was a fine fellow; he would make his
way in the world in spite of the luck that was against
him now.</p>

<p>&#8220;My boy,&#8221; (and the Judge laid his hands affectionately
on the young man&#8217;s shoulders as they stood
facing each other) &#8220;I know you to be a gentleman, and
I believe you to be every inch a manly man. I want my
child to marry not what a man has made, but what he
is made of. You will win in the world&#8217;s rough and
tumble of money-making, if you&#8217;re only given a
chance; and I&#8217;ve been going to tell you that there&#8217;s a
place waiting for you in our San Francisco office when
you are ready for it. And now I&#8217;ll add, there&#8217;s a
place in my family, whenever Evy says so.</p>

<p>&#8220;As to your not having much more than the proverbial
shilling just now, that cuts no figure with me.
Why not? Let me tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He put his arm around Evaleen, drawing her to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;This child&#8217;s mother took me &#8216;for better or worse&#8217;
twenty-five years ago this very night, when I hadn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
a dollar in the world that I could call my own&mdash;married
me on an hour&#8217;s notice, and without any wedding
guests or wedding gowns. She trusted me and loved
me well enough to take me as I was, and to trust to
the future (God bless her!) and neither of us have ever
had cause to regret it.&#8221;</p>

<p>To have this assurance from the Judge before he
knew of the wonderful story Sherwood had to tell of
the secret of Crazy Dan&#8217;s tunnel, added to the joy of
the young people who now felt they were beloved of
the gods.</p>

<p>The Judge&#8217;s joy over the finding of the treasure
box was even greater than Sherwood&#8217;s; for the older
man had lived long enough to realize (as a younger
generation could not) that this wealth would put many
possibilities for happiness within their reach that otherwise
might not be theirs. To them&mdash;the lovers in the
rose-dawn of youth, with love so new&mdash;love itself
seemed enough; save perhaps that the money would
make marriage a nearer possibility.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;Darling&#8221;&mdash;and a new thought, a new hope rang
through Sherwood&#8217;s earnest tones&mdash;&#8220;do you believe
you love me as well as she&mdash;your mother&mdash;loved him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Hume!&#8221; was all she said, but the reproach in
her eyes answered him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then marry me now, as she did your father, at an
hour&#8217;s notice. Here&mdash;this evening, before the train
comes. Judge, why can not this be so? What is there
to prevent our being married at once, without all the
fussing and nonsense that will be necessary if we wait
till she gets home? Let us be married here, and now,
and all go away together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, bless my soul! This takes my breath away.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
You young people&mdash;what whirlwinds you are! You&mdash;Yes,
yes, but&mdash;&mdash; Hey? What&#8217;s that? I did?
I know; but&mdash;&mdash; What? I should rather think it
would be a surprise to mother and the girls to bring a
son home to Christmas dinner. Oh, yes, I know;
but&mdash;&mdash; What&#8217;s that you say? Her mother did&mdash;&mdash;!
Yes, yes, I know.... Well, well, my lad, I don&#8217;t know
but you&#8217;re right. Her mother&mdash;&mdash; Love is the one
thing&mdash;the rest doesn&#8217;t matter. Evy, child, it is for you
to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>And remembering that girl of the long-ago who
twenty-five years before had gone to a penniless lover
with such a beautiful love and trust Evaleen Blaine,
putting her hand with a like trust into her lover&#8217;s,
walked with him across to the little parsonage, and
there became Hume Sherwood&#8217;s wife.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Cadwallader got back to the camp the next
morning, he heard much he was unprepared for; for
news travels fast where happenings are few. What
he heard did not tend to make his Christmas a merry
one.</p>

<p>Evaleen Blaine and Hume Sherwood were now man
and wife! He did not want to believe it, yet he felt it
was true. And Sherwood had sent to the mint (from
the &#8220;Spencer&#8221; mine, too,) the largest shipment of bullion
that had ever gone out of the county! Neither
did he want to believe this&mdash;and did not. There must
be some mistake.</p>

<p>He went over to the express office through the snow
and the cold; for the rain had turned to snow and the
Nevada winter had begun. It would be a cheerless
yule-tide for him. It was true as he had heard&mdash;true
in all particulars, except that the consignment to
the mint had been in gold dust, not in bullion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>Elwyn Cadwallader knew mines. Therefore he knew
ledges do not produce gold dust; and Sherwood had
owned no placers. Whatever suspicion he had of the
truth he kept to himself. It was enough for him to
know that all he had done to make Hume Sherwood the
butt of the camp, that he might all the more surely part
him from Evaleen Blaine, had been but the means of
aiding him in winning her; and that the richest joke
of the camp had proved to be rich indeed, in that it had
placed a great fortune in the hands of &#8220;the deckel-edged
tenderfoot.&#8221;</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
